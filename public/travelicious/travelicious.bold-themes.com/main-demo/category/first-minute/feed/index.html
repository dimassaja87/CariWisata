					<description><![CDATA[Bellagio is a village on a promontory jutting out into Lake Como, in Italy. It’s known for its cobbled lanes, elegant buildings and Villa Serbelloni Park, an 18th-century terraced garden with lake views. Nearby are the Tower of the Arts, a venue for exhibitions and performances, and the Romanesque San Giacomo Church. Close to rocky Loppia Beach, the Museum of Navigational Instruments displays sundials and compasses.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Experience the dramatic beauty of the Italian Lakes on this day tour from Milan. You will visit Lake Como which is the most scenic of the three Italian lakes.</p>
<p>All the towns that lie on the banks of Lake Como enjoy breathtaking scenery of the Alps and the aqua-blue waters of Lake Como. You will see wonderful old villas and gardens with plenty of flowers and exotic plants. Como gained world fame in the 20th century thanks to the novel ‘The Betrothed’, by Alessandro Manzoni, set on the Lecco branch of the Lake.</p>
<blockquote><p>You can&#8217;t stand at the Bellagio and watch these seven story fountains and not go, &#8216;That&#8217;s something of extraordinary man-made beauty.<br />
<cite>Joe Carnahan</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>The tour is accompanied by an English-speaking guide, you will be taken on a coach tour to Lake Como. With a surface of 146 square metres, Lake Como is the third largest lake in Italy, after Lake Garda and Lake Maggiore. Its peculiar shape, an upturned Y, is due to its three branches: Colico, the northern branch, Lecco, the south east branch and Como, the south west branch.</p>
<p>Take a tour of the Como city centre and admire its beautiful old villas and learn about the history of Lombardy. The sites worth visiting are: silk museum, civic museum and Alessandro Volta museum.</p>
<p>Take a boat cruise on Lake Como (approximately 2 hours) to Bellagio, a commune in the province of Como. Perched at the tip of the peninsula separating the lake’s two southern arms, it is possible to get a view of the Alps across the lake. Here you will have free time to enjoy lunch. Transfer by boat from Bellagio to Cadenabbia.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Malaysia is a Southeast Asian country occupying parts of the Malay Peninsula and the island of Borneo. It's known for its beaches, rainforests and mix of Malay, Chinese, Indian and European cultural influences. The capital, Kuala Lumpur, is home to colonial buildings, busy shopping districts such as Bukit Bintang and skyscrapers such as the iconic, 451m-tall Petronas Twin Towers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Malaysia offers the visitor a wide array of diverse attractions. First, it is necessary to understand the geography of the country. It consists of two distinct parts, Peninsula Malaysia and Malaysian Borneo separated by the South China Sea. Between the two sections of the country, Malaysia consists of modern cities, beach resorts, rainforests, jungle, highland retreats, national parks and much more. The country has an abundance of outstanding natural beauty be it gorgeous beaches, exotic mountainous terrain or fascinating tropical rainforests. Malaysia’s national parks are superb for trekking and wildlife-watching, and sometimes for cave exploration and river rafting on Malaysia vacations.</p>
<blockquote><p>Malaysia is a country unlike any other: Full of promise and fragility. Its history, cultural and religious diversity make it a rich, compelling and surprising land.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another Malaysian quality is its multiethnic influences with its predominant native Malay, Chinese and Indian cultures all live side by side together in peace and harmony. This mixture has influenced both the cultural diversity and the varied cuisine of Malaysia. It is no wonder that Malays love celebrating and socializing. As a people, Malaysians are very relaxed, warm and friendly.</p>

<h5><strong>What are the top cities to visit in Malaysia?</strong></h5>
<p>Where to go and what to see on Malaysia tours? Starting with Peninsula Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur is the capital, a city which combines the old and the new with its bustling markets, steel-clad skyscrapers, large shopping malls and trendy nightspots. It’s hard to not notice the twin Petronas Towers, opened in 1998 and world’s tallest structure until 2004 which offer amazing views of the city. Merdeka Square, where Malaysian independence was declared in 1957, is ringed by heritage buildings. The colourful, ornate Sri Mahamariamman Temple is a lively Hindu temple and the oldest in Malaysia. To see the Chinese influence, head to Petaling Street with its restaurants and street food stalls.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2362 size-large" src="http://travelicious.omnicom-dev.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2018/07/post_malaysia_01-1280x854.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="801" srcset="https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/07/post_malaysia_01-1280x854.jpg 1280w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/07/post_malaysia_01-640x427.jpg 640w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/07/post_malaysia_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/07/post_malaysia_01-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/07/post_malaysia_01-800x534.jpg 800w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/07/post_malaysia_01-320x213.jpg 320w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/07/post_malaysia_01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/07/post_malaysia_01.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h5><strong>What are the top places to see in Malaysia?</strong></h5>
<p>Just outside the city is the sumptuous National Palace contained in its own grounds and home to the elected Monarch. Also close to Kuala Lumpur are the Batu Caves with their Hindu rock carvings and unique rock formations. The best known museum is the National Museum with its exhibits from Malaysian history and crafts.</p>
<p>On Malaysia vacations, the second most important destination is Penang, literally an island off the coast of Western Peninsula Malaysia. Georgetown, its capital, brings back memories of the old colonial era depicted in its architecture and the historic Fort Cornwallis built in the late 18th Century. However, perhaps Penang’s biggest attraction is its beach resorts such as those found in Batu Ferringhi. A visit to Penang Hill introduces you to some of the grandest colonial mansions while enjoying the cool, refreshing air and panoramic views of the island. Another attraction is the tropical butterfly farm in Teluk Bahang with its live museum of winged butterflies. Something different is the Snake Temple, home to several pit vipers and green tree snakes and featured in “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom”.</p>

<p>Malacca, in the south, has a colonial past reflected in its preserved town centre. Influences include Portuguese, Dutch and British rules that all left behind their historical and cultural backgrounds. The older part of the city has, in addition to the old palace and the large buildings left by the Europeans, many private houses and shops from nearly a century or more ago. Some of the buildings well worth visiting are the Cheng Hoon Teng Temple, the oldest Chinese temple in Malaysia, the Fort of Santiago from the Portuguese era and St. Paul’s Church, originally built in 1521 by the Portuguese. It has been used as a burial ground for the Dutch and you can still see the tombstone along the walls of ruins of the church.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Brussels is full of life, but even more so in the summer! A city bursting with energy, moving to a summer beat. Let your hair down to the tune of street entertainment and city festivals, in a setting of amazing and diverse, tiny or imposing buildings, each with their own history, and a huge amount of green spaces to sit and catch your breath.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Belgian capital is one of Europe&#8217;s lesser-known gems, yet it&#8217;s fully worth a visit. In addition to some of the best waffles and chocolates worldwide, the city boasts an amazing array of things to see and do. Not convinced? Here&#8217;s a sample of highlights.</p>
<h5><strong>French fries? Belgian fries!</strong></h5>
<p>As any Belgian will proudly tell you, they are the true inventors of the deep-fried potato. Try out the Belgian fries and decide for yourself whether the much-touted double-frying method is worth all the hype (best enjoyed together with a steaming bowl of clams, which restaurants customarily serve with a bottomless side of fries).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Prague, capital city of the Czech Republic, is bisected by the Vltava River. Nicknamed “the City of a Hundred Spires,” it's known for its Old Town Square, the heart of its historic core, with colorful baroque buildings, Gothic churches and the medieval Astronomical Clock, which gives an animated hourly show. Completed in 1402, pedestrian Charles Bridge is lined with statues of Catholic saints.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite its relatively small size, the Czech capital of Prague is jam-packed with magnificent sights, each endowed with a long and varied history. To make the most of your visit there, make sure to include these 10 attractions in your itinerary.</p>
<h5><strong>Vltava River</strong></h5>
<p>The Vltava River cuts across Prague&#8217;s centre. Jump aboard one of the many tour boats and take in the wonderful sights on both sides of the river while sipping a delicious Czech beer.</p>
<h5><strong>Charles Bridge</strong></h5>
<p>600 years old, Charles Bridge is one of Prague&#8217;s most iconic landmarks. Beautifully decorated with rows of 30 baroque-style statues, it&#8217;s a perfect spot for a romantic stroll.</p>
<h5><strong>Old Town Square</strong></h5>
<p>The Old Town Square in Prague offers a charmingly eclectic mix of architectural styles spanning several centuries – undoubtedly one of Europe&#8217;s most beautiful sights.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2245" src="http://travelicious.omnicom-dev.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/04/post_09-1280x854.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="801" srcset="https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/04/post_09-1280x854.jpg 1280w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/04/post_09-640x427.jpg 640w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/04/post_09-768x512.jpg 768w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/04/post_09-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/04/post_09-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/04/post_09-800x533.jpg 800w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/04/post_09-320x213.jpg 320w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/04/post_09-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h5><strong>Discover Czech Beer</strong></h5>
<p>True to its reputation, Czech beer is delicious. A newcomer might be confused by the beer&#8217;s alcohol content, however. Don&#8217;t worry, the numbers given to the beers don&#8217;t indicate their alcohol percentage. They refer to the alcohol degree, which is a much more complicated factor. As a rule of thumb, 10 and 12 degrees, the most common, are equivalent to roughly 4% and 5% respectively. Some beers go all the way up to 19 degrees – that&#8217;s 8% alcohol!</p>
<h5><strong>Try a Czech Hot Dog</strong></h5>
<p>Believe it or not, one of Prague&#8217;s culinary highlights are its hot dogs. Infinitely superior to their American counterparts, these delicious sausages stuffed in French baguettes offer the best cheap lunch in town. Stalls are peppered throughout the city, just take your pick!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5><strong>Safari Philosophy</strong></h5>
<p>Without wanting to turn the traditional game drive completely on its head, the Angama Mara guiding team felt it might be time to shake things up a little: the team struck on the idea of crafting game drives around the guest. Guests are asked where they have been; what they have seen; what their great passions are; what they would like to do and when they would like to do it; and for how long they would like to be on a game drive at any one time – and game drives are structured accordingly.</p>
<p>The pace is a little slower here because all of Angama Mara’s guests come to East Africa to see game, and game there is a-plenty. They might start their safari in the Mara and want to do many game drives; they might come here in the middle of their journey and do a little less game viewing; or they might end their adventure at Angama Mara and only go down into the Reserve to find something they might not have seen. One fact for certain is that the Mara Triangle consistently delivers twelve months of the year – so one can afford to take things a little slower, and enjoy a much more flexible day on safari no matter what time of year.</p>
<h5><strong>A day on safari</strong></h5>
<p>Guests could leave the lodge at dawn, or decide to go on a game drive after breakfast, descend down Angama Mara’s private road and 10-minutes later find themselves in the heart of the action – surrounded by more animals than they could imagine: the vast grasslands dotted with acacias are home to abundant herds, as well as Africa’s Big Five – lion, leopard, elephant, rhino and buffalo.</p>
<p>Safaris are conducted in the lovely Mara Triangle, open from sunrise to sunset, and are in completely open gameviewing vehicles to which the animals are well accustomed – the vehicles are specially equipped and converted, offering comfy seats, ample legroom, charging stations and canvas roofs for respite from the sun.</p>

<p>Because the weather is so mild in the Mara, there are no constraints as to when to go on a game drive, and Angama Mara guests tailor-make their safari days: out early and back for breakfast; out early with a picnic breakfast and back for lunch; out after breakfast with a picnic lunch and back mid-afternoon; a post lunch game drive and back at sunset; or very best of all, spending a whole day exploring the Mara Triangle – with a picnic breakfast and lunch down at the Tanzanian border without a soul in sight – that’s an all-time favourite and a grand way to spend the day.</p>
<h5><strong>Something for everyone</strong></h5>
<p>Angama Mara’s experienced guides tailor-make their guest’s safari days: first-timers to Africa will be guided differently to old-timers, and there are over 570-recorded species of birds which will keep birding enthusiasts busy. First and foremost, the guides are storytellers, and interpret the Mara in a way that immerses their guests in the surroundings: a safari at Angama Mara is about an overwhelming sense of place. Guests will have the opportunity to enjoy the knowledge and companionship of more than one guide as their desired safari experience changes from day to day, and the guiding team will endeavour to match like-minded guests with each other: birders will go on safari with fellow birders, as will those with a keen interest in photography or another special interest.</p>
<h5><strong>A rocking safari</strong></h5>
<p>Guests at Angama Mara can also enjoy the wonders of a safari without leaving the comfort of their deck: the views of the Mara from the tented suites are staggering – the sky never sits still and there is always something to spot 300m below – elephant families melting in and out of the forest, a thousand buffalo lazing about, giraffe stepping daintily down from the escarpment or a pod of hippo moving from one water body to the next. All the tents are equipped with binoculars and there is a spotting scope in the guest area. There are heaps of resident game around the lodge: eland, zebra, giraffe, topi and impala; and watching the raptors soar effortlessly above and below you is a great way to while away the hours.</p>
