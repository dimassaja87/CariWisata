										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paris, France&#8217;s capital, is a major European city and a global center for art, fashion, gastronomy and culture. Its 19th-century cityscape is crisscrossed by wide boulevards and the River Seine. Beyond such landmarks as the Eiffel Tower and the 12th-century, Gothic Notre-Dame cathedral, the city is known for its cafe culture and designer boutiques along the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré.</p>
<h5><strong>Why Our Insiders Chose This Tour</strong></h5>
<p>This Eiffel Tower experience includes summit access, allowing you to go right to the top after exploring the second floor. When you board the elevator for the summit, be sure to hit record on your mobile for a dizzying video of the view and ironwork.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast.<br />
<cite>Ernest Hemingway</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>Bypass the long lines at the Eiffel Tower with this 1-hour tour accompanied by a host, including summit access. After fast track, skip-the-line access, proceed to the second level to survey the city from the viewing platforms while listening to commentary about Paris culture, traditions, and history. Then, proceed to the summit to see Gustave Eiffel&#8217;s private apartments and sip Champagne from the onsite bar (own expense).</p>

<h5><strong>What You Can Expect</strong></h5>
<p>Choose an entry time when booking; meet your host near the Eiffel Tower a half hour prior to your scheduled time. With your group, stroll the short distance to one of the world&#8217;s busiest monuments. Bypass the long lines and head straight for the elevators, enjoying speedy and stress-free access to the second floor. Step out with your host to take in some of the best panoramic views in Paris from the viewing platform, 375 feet (114 meters) above the ground.</p>
<p>Get a basic orientation to the sights and landmarks visible from your vantage point from your host, then explore the area at your leisure. Snap photos of the Louvre, Les Invalides, Sacré Coeur, Notre Dame Cathedral, and the Champ de Mars, among other standout Parisian highlights. After you&#8217;ve had your fill of the second level, proceed to the summit, where you can toast your trip with Champagne from the bar and view Gustave Eiffel&#8217;s private apartments.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Cape Town is a port city on South Africa’s southwest coast, on a peninsula beneath the imposing Table Mountain. Slowly rotating cable cars climb to the mountain’s flat top, from which there are sweeping views of the city, the busy harbor and boats heading for Robben Island, the notorious prison that once held Nelson Mandela, which is now a living museum.]]></description>

However, an excursion to the 3,500-foot summit always depends on the weather, so check it before you go. It&#8217;s wise to bring a sweater with you, and wear sunblock and proper footware. If you plan hiking to the peak or along one of the trails at the summit, be safe and bring water, snacks and a friend.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[India is a vast South Asian country with diverse terrain – from Himalayan peaks to Indian Ocean coastline – and history reaching back 5 millennia. In the north, Mughal Empire landmarks include Delhi’s Red Fort complex and massive Jama Masjid mosque, plus Agra’s iconic Taj Mahal mausoleum. Pilgrims bathe in the Ganges in Varanasi, and Rishikesh is a yoga centre and base for Himalayan trekking.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Beaches fringed by the Indian Ocean, hectic but mesmerising cities, marble covered palaces and Kerala’s coconut coastline; holidays in India are a feast for the senses.</p>
<p>The energy and spirit that dances through India comes from the first explosion of patchouli incensed balmy air to the second or third bizarre glimpse of a cow ambling along the road on your wild rickshaw journey into Delhi. There’s that breathtaking first sighting of the pink city of Jaipur and a spectacular sunrise view of the Taj Mahal.</p>
<blockquote><p>I have lived a long life, and I am proud that I spend the whole of my life in the service of my people. I am only proud of this and nothing else. I shall continue to serve until my last breath, and when I die, I can say, that every drop of my blood will invigorate India and strengthen it.<br />
<cite>Indira Gandhi</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>India holidays are all encompassing – one moment mouth-watering street food in Mumbai, the next a gastronomic feast in Udaipur; one day a cacophony of vibrant market shopping, Hindu temples and sacred statues, another a sedate afternoon cruising the Keralan backwaters. Imagine regal hotels clad in cool marble, cities built by Mughal emperors, undiscovered rural corners where you can share a cup of chai with locals and Rajasthan’s hectic but resplendent cities.</p>
