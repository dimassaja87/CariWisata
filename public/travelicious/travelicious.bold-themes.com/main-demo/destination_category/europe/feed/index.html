					<description><![CDATA[Zagreb is made for strolling. Wander through the Upper Town's red-roof and cobblestone glory, peppered with church spires. Crane your neck to see the domes and ornate upper-floor frippery of the Lower Town's mash-up of secessionist, neo-baroque and art deco buildings.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Search out the grittier pockets of town where ugly-bland concrete walls have been transformed into colourful murals by local street artists. This city rewards those on foot.</p>
<blockquote style="text-align: center;"><p>If your Mediterranean fantasies feature balmy days by sapphire waters in the shade of ancient walled towns, Croatia is the place to turn into reality.</p></blockquote>
<p>Afterwards, do as the locals do and head to a cafe. The cafe-culture here is just one facet of this city&#8217;s vibrant street life, egged on by a year-round swag of events that bring music, pop-up markets and food stalls to the plazas and parks. Even when there&#8217;s nothing on, the centre thrums with youthful energy so it&#8217;s no surprise that Croatia&#8217;s capital is now bringing in the city-break crowd. Zagreb is the little city that could.</p>

<h5><strong>Beauty on the Inside</strong></h5>
<p>Shift your gaze for just a moment from the glittering waters and chances are an almighty mountain will loom into view. The Dinaric Alps, which stretch all the way from Italy to Albania, hug much of the coast. The limestone karst has bequeathed a wonderland of craggy peaks, caverns, river canyons, waterfalls and ridiculously picturesque lakes. Head further inland and things flatten out again into rolling farmland. Active types will find plenty of chances to get among it on the numerous hiking and biking trails, while the more adventurous can have a go at rock climbing, rafting and zip-lining.</p>

<h5><strong>Cultural Feast</strong></h5>
<p>If you&#8217;re lucky enough to cross the tourist/guest barrier and be invited into a local&#8217;s home, you&#8217;ll soon become acquainted with the refrain &#8216;Jedi! Jedi! Jedi!&#8217; (Eat! Eat! Eat!). Sharing food and drink plays a big part in the culture here, which speaks both to the nature of Croatian hospitality and to the quality of local produce. Simple home-style cooking is a feature of family-run taverns, but increasingly a new breed of chefs are bringing a more adventurous approach to the table. Meanwhile, Croatian wines and olive oils are making their mark on the world stage, garnering top awards.</p>

Deeper in Belgrade&#8217;s bowels are museums guarding the cultural, religious and military heritage of the country. &#8216;Belgrade&#8217; translates as &#8216;White City&#8217;, but Serbia&#8217;s capital is red hot.</span></p>

If you didn&#8217;t taste products and food, either typical for that destination or those which represent new trends in local cuisine, you are not able to think you have learned it all! After this tour you will feel yourself more of a Serbian Expert! The tour starts at prominent Republic Square blow the Big Clock in Belgrade’s downtown at 10:00 am. First we will start with a morning coffee in a local charming café at Cara Dušana Street in famous Dorćol quarter. Coffee drinking is a ritual for locals that lets them enjoy a cup of energizing coffee and dynamic chitchat. At the coffee bar you will enjoy some good quality coffee prepared in Serbian manner and, in case you like it, purchase some for warming memories!</p>
<p>Here you will hear story how coffee was brought to Belgrade and how this ritual became a solution for every private or business challenge. After getting a dose of caffeine you will be ready to research one of the oldest green markets in Belgrade, known as Bajloni market even though its official name is Skadarska Market. On the way to market, you will stop by in a bakery to purchase some bruschetta for upcoming cheese-tasting on the market.</p>

When you get to the Bajloni market, you will feel the taste of rural Serbia: villages where these dairy products are produced and where the fresh vegetables and fruits are grown. Markets in Belgrade are kinda live social networks where you can get well informed about all daily happenings.</p>
<p>You will, of course, get informed on how the first market in Belgrade was set.

Here you will enjoy an 8-course lunch enriched with chef’s story about ingredients and preparation. It is quite an experience letting you learn about new trends in organic agriculture and development of national cuisine. After the lunch you will better understand rhythm of Belgrade.

					<description><![CDATA[Barcelona is an enchanting seaside city with boundless culture, fabled architecture and a world-class drinking and dining scene. Towering temple columns, ancient city walls and subterranean stone corridors provide a window into Roman-era Barcino.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<section id="bt_bb_section63e456c9bbc30" class="bt_bb_section bt_bb_layout_wide bt_bb_vertical_align_top"  data-bt-override-class="null"><div class="bt_bb_port"><div class="bt_bb_cell"><div class="bt_bb_cell_inner"><div class="bt_bb_row_wrapper"><div  class="bt_bb_row"  data-bt-override-class="{}"><div  class="bt_bb_column col-xl-12 bt_bb_vertical_align_top bt_bb_align_left bt_bb_padding_normal"  data-width="12" data-bt-override-class="{}"><div class="bt_bb_column_content"><div class="bt_bb_column_content_inner"><div  class="bt_bb_text" ><h5><strong>Architecture of the Ages</strong></h5>
<p>Barcelona&#8217;s architectural treasures span 2000-plus years. Towering temple columns, ancient city walls and subterranean stone corridors provide a window into Roman-era Barcino. Fast forward a thousand years or so to the Middle Ages by taking a stroll through the shadowy lanes of the Gothic quarter, past tranquil plazas and soaring 14th-century cathedrals.</p>
<p>In other parts of town bloom the sculptural masterpieces of Modernisme, a mix of ingenious and whimsical creations by Gaudí and his Catalan architectural contemporaries. Barcelona has also long inspired artists, including Pablo Picasso and Joan Miró, both of whom have major Barcelona museums devoted to their works.</p>
<h5><strong>A Moveable Feast</strong></h5>
<p>The masters of molecular gastronomy – Albert Adrià, Carles Abellan et al – are part of the long and celebrated tradition of Catalan cooking. Simple, flavourful ingredients – seafood, jamón (cured ham), market-fresh produce – are transformed into remarkable delicacies and then served in captivating settings.</p>
<p>Feast on hearty, rich paella at an outdoor table overlooking the sea or step back to the 1920s at an elegant art nouveau dining room. Barcelona&#8217;s wide-ranging palate adds further complexity: Basque-style tapas bars, Galician seafood taverns, avant-garde Japanese restaurants and sinful chocolate shops are all essential parts of the culinary landscape.</p>

<p>The deep blue Mediterranean beckons. Sun-drenched beaches make a fine backdrop to a jog, bike ride or long leisurely stroll along the seaside – followed by a refreshing dip. You can also enjoy the view from out on the water while kayaking, stand-up paddleboarding or taking it easy on a sunset cruise.</p>
<p>Looming behind the city, the rolling forest-covered Collserola hills provide a scenic setting for hiking, mountain biking or just admiring the view. Closer to the city centre, hilltop Montjuïc offers endless exploring amid botanic and sculpture gardens, an old castle and first-rate museums with panoramic views at every turn.</p>
<h5><strong>Twenty-four-hour Party People</strong></h5>
<p>The night holds limitless possibilities in Barcelona. Start with sunset drinks on a panoramic terrace or dig your heels in the sand at a rustic beachside chiringuito (bar). As darkness falls, live music transforms the city: the rapid-fire rhythms of flamenco, brassy jazz spilling out of basements, and hands-in-the-air indie-rock at vintage concert halls.</p>
<p>Towards midnight the bars fill. Take your pick from old-school taverns adorned with 19th-century murals, plush lounges in lamp-lit medieval chambers or boisterous cava bars. If you&#8217;re still standing at 3am, hit the clubs and explore Barcelona&#8217;s unabashed wild side.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<section id="bt_bb_section63e456c9bcd17" class="bt_bb_section bt_bb_layout_wide bt_bb_vertical_align_top"  data-bt-override-class="null"><div class="bt_bb_port"><div class="bt_bb_cell"><div class="bt_bb_cell_inner"><div class="bt_bb_row_wrapper"><div  class="bt_bb_row"  data-bt-override-class="{}"><div  class="bt_bb_column col-xl-12 bt_bb_vertical_align_top bt_bb_align_left bt_bb_padding_normal"  data-width="12" data-bt-override-class="{}"><div class="bt_bb_column_content"><div class="bt_bb_column_content_inner"><div  class="bt_bb_text" ><h5><strong>Time Travel</strong></h5>
<p>Immersed in history, London&#8217;s rich seams of eye-opening antiquity are everywhere. The city&#8217;s buildings are striking milestones in a unique and beguiling biography, and a great many of them – the Tower of London, Westminster Abbey, Big Ben – are instantly recognisable landmarks. There’s more than enough innovation (the Shard, the Tate Modern extension, the planned Garden Bridge) to put a crackle in the air, but it never drowns out London’s seasoned, centuries-old narrative. Architectural grandeur rises up all around you in the West End, ancient remains dot the City and charming pubs punctuate the historic quarters, leafy suburbs and river banks. Take your pick.</p>
<blockquote style="text-align: center;"><p>A bad day in London is still better than a good day anywhere else.</p></blockquote>
<h5><strong>Art &amp; Culture</strong></h5>
<p>A tireless innovator of art and culture, London is a city of ideas and the imagination. Londoners have always been fiercely independent thinkers (and critics), but until not so long ago people were suspicious of anything they considered avant-garde. That’s in the past now, and the city’s creative milieu is streaked with left-field attitude, whether it&#8217;s theatrical innovation, contemporary art, pioneering music, writing, poetry, architecture or design. Food is another creative arena that has become a tireless obsession in certain circles.</p>

<p>This city is deeply multicultural, with one in three Londoners foreign-born, representing 270 nationalities and 300 tongues. Britain may have voted for Brexit (although the majority of Londoners didn&#8217;t), but for now London remains one of the world&#8217;s most cosmopolitan cities, and diversity infuses daily life, food, music and fashion. It even penetrates intrinsically British institutions; the British Museum and Victoria &amp; Albert Museum have collections as varied as they are magnificent, while the flavours at centuries-old Borough Market run the full global gourmet spectrum.</p>

<p>London is as much about wide-open vistas and leafy landscape escapes as it is high-density, sight-packed urban exploration. Central London is where the major museums, galleries and most iconic sights congregate, but visit Hampstead Heath or the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park to flee the crowds and frolic in wide open green expanses. You can also venture further out to Kew Gardens, Richmond or Hampton Court Palace for beautiful panoramas of riverside London followed by a pint in a quiet waterside pub.</p>

<p>Bismarck and Marx, Einstein and Hitler, JFK and Bowie, they’ve all shaped – and been shaped by – Berlin, whose richly textured history confronts you at every turn. This is a city that staged a revolution, was headquartered by Nazis, bombed to bits, divided in two and finally reunited – and that was just in the 20th century! Walk along remnants of the Berlin Wall, marvel at the splendour of a Prussian palace, visit Checkpoint Charlie or stand in the very room where the Holocaust was planned. Berlin is like an endlessly fascinating 3D textbook where the past is very much present wherever you go.</p>

<p>Forget about New York – Berlin is the city that truly never sleeps. Sometimes it seems as though Berliners are the lotus-eaters of Germany, people who love nothing more than a good time. The city&#8217;s vast party spectrum caters for every taste, budget and age group. From tiny basement clubs to industrial techno temples, chestnut-canopied beer gardens to fancy cocktail caverns, saucy cabarets to ear-pleasing symphonies – Berlin delivers hot-stepping odysseys, and not just after dark and on weekends but pretty much 24/7. Pack your stamina!</p>

<p>When it comes to creativity, the sky’s the limit in Berlin, which is one of Europe&#8217;s big start-up capitals. In the last 20 years, the city has become a giant lab of cultural experimentation thanks to a spirit that nurtures and encourages new ideas as well as to once abundant space and cheap rent. Although the last two of these are definitely a thing of the past. Top international performers still grace Berlin&#8217;s theatre, concert and opera stages; international art-world stars like Olafur Eliasson and Jonathan Meese make their home here; and Clooney and Hanks shoot blockbusters in the German capital. Highbrow, lowbrow and everything in between – there’s plenty of room for the full gamut of cultural expression.</p>

<p>Berlin is a big multicultural metropolis but deep down it maintains the unpretentious charm of an international village. Locals and expats follow the credo &#8216;live and let live&#8217; and put greater emphasis on personal freedom and a creative lifestyle than on material wealth and status symbols. Cafes are jammed at all hours, drinking is a religious rite and clubs keep going through the weekend into Monday. Size-wise, Berlin is pretty big but its key areas are wonderfully compact and easily navigated on foot, by bike or with public transport.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5><strong>Acropolis Views</strong></h5>
<p>The magnificent Acropolis, visible from almost every part of the city, is the hub around which Athens still revolves. This temple city, built in the 5th century BC, serves as a daily reminder to Greeks of their heritage and the city&#8217;s many transformations. All over the urban basin, rooftops and balconies angle toward the landmark, a block of milky marble atop a steep-sided hill. Pull up your own chair, settle in and allow time to appreciate the Acropolis&#8217; many moods, as the light shifts and the clouds cast their shifting shadows.</p>
<blockquote style="text-align: center;"><p>With equal measures of grunge and grace, Athens is a heady mix of history and edginess.</p></blockquote>
<h5><strong>Layers of History</strong></h5>
<p>The cultural and social life of Athens plays out amid, around and in landmarks that are centuries old, if not millennia. The remnants of Ancient Greece get the most attention, of course, thanks to a little thing called democracy. Oh, and mythology, and drama, and philosophy. But don&#8217;t overlook the &#8216;later&#8217; years: thousand-year-old Byzantine churches, for instance, which squat, unruffled in the middle of streets and attached to hillsides. Ottoman traces can be seen in architecture and in food. And the neoclassical style of the 19th century adds elegance all over the centre.</p>

<h5><strong>Creative Energy</strong></h5>
<p>Although individuals have endured difficult circumstances since the start of the economic crisis in 2009, the city as a whole crackles with energy in art shows, political debates and even on the walls of derelict buildings, as Athens has become one of Europe&#8217;s most noted spots for street art. There are plenty of surprises to be discovered, so make sure to leave room in your schedule for spontaneous discovery: buy a ticket to that dance show that&#8217;s just starting as you walk by, or sit down at the restaurant where the musicians are setting up. You&#8217;ll be rewarded.</p>

<h5><strong>Beaches and Ruins</strong></h5>
<p>Beyond Athens, down the Attica peninsula, are more spectacular antiquities, such as the Temple of Poseidon at Sounion and the site of Ancient Eleusis, as well as very good beaches, such as those near historic Marathon. Sure, you could zip across, west to east, in less than an hour, but it&#8217;s far more fun to take a leisurely road trip to a mineral-filled lake, say, or a monastery with dazzling Byzantine mosaics. If you&#8217;d rather not drive, though, most of these surprise sights (including great beaches) can be reached on public transport.</p>

<h5><strong>History</strong></h5>
<p>You can get a full primer on Icelandic history right in central Reykjavík, from its Settlement Exhibition built around the unearthed Viking longhouse of the area&#8217;s earliest inhabitants to the enormous National Museum, keeper of the country&#8217;s most precious artefacts.In the Old Harbour you can enthrall the kids at a high-octane Saga Museum, or learn about the area&#8217;s maritime history. And, as you make your way around, try to slip behind the shiny tourist-centric veneer to find today&#8217;s people, who mix aesthetic-minded ingenuity with an almost quaint, know-your-neighbours sense of community.</p>

<h5><strong>Art &amp; Design</strong></h5>
<p>The capital&#8217;s art museums, shops and galleries are a perfect insight into contemporary city life. They include outstanding exhibition spaces, such as the Reykjavík Art Museum and National Gallery, as well as shops featuring cutting-edge Icelandic design. Edgy contemporary art galleries such as those in the Marshall House showcase emerging and internationally famous Icelandic artists.Reykjavík also presents the chance to see Icelandic cinema with English subtitles. Or, wander the streets photographing creative graffiti and public art installations, like the ever-popular seaside Sun Voyager sculpture, which changes guises along with the light.</p>

<h5><strong>The Great Outdoors</strong></h5>
<p>Even if you come to Reykjavík for a short visit, be sure to take a trip to the countryside. Tours and services abound, and understanding Reykjavík and its people is helped by understanding the vast, raw land they anchor. The majority of Icelanders live in the capital, but you can guarantee their spirits also roam free across the land. Absorb what you see, hear, taste, smell – all part of Iceland&#8217;s rich heritage.Take Reykjavík, then add its snow-topped mountains, churning seas and crystal-clear air, and the chances are you&#8217;ll fall helplessly in love, heading home already saving to return.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The popular perception of the Netherlands' third-largest city is of a stately, regal place populated with bureaucrats and businesspeople. Easy to explore on foot or by tram, this is a country that amply rewards those who stay for a few days.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5><strong>Art &amp; Architecture</strong></h5>
<p>In a country that gave birth to celebrated Dutch Masters like Rembrandt, Vermeer, Van Gogh and Piet Mondrian, the art legacy is huge. World-renowned art museums in Amsterdam, Den Haag, Rotterdam, Haarlem and Leiden drip with iconic masterpieces, alongside a respectable portfolio of contemporary works. The Dutch influence on construction spans more than a millennia, from Romanesque and Gothic medieval magnum opuses to Dutch Renaissance palaces and romantic Golden Age gabled houses. Trailblazing contemporary architecture – green and innovative – is a perfect reflection of a country perfectly in tune with its environment (and the need to protect it).</p>
<blockquote style="text-align: center;"><p>Tradition and innovation intertwine here: artistic masterpieces, centuries-old windmills, tulip fields and romantic candlelit cafés coexist with visionary architecture, cutting-edge design and phenomenal nightlife.</p></blockquote>
<h5><strong>Cycling</strong></h5>
<p>With fabulously pancake-flat, scenic landscapes beckoning along every last dyke, canal, river and coastal shore, two-wheeling in the Netherlands is one of Dutch life&#8217;s greatest pleasures (headwinds notwithstanding). While the bike-loving Dutch practically live on their well-worn, beloved fietsen (bicycles) – many, infamously only with back-pedal coaster brakes – cycling for visitors is a wonderful means of exploring and getting around. Bike-rental outlets are ubiquitous, and the country is criss-crossed with some 32,000km of cycling paths, including the Dutch &#8216;motorways&#8217; of cycling, the long-distance LF routes. Grab some wheels and go!</p>

<h5><strong>Café Culture</strong></h5>
<p>When the Dutch say café they mean a pub, and there are thousands – with glorious summertime terraces peppering flower-strewn canals, looking out to sea, hidden down ancient lanes, standing on every town&#8217;s Grote Markt (market square). In a country that values socialising and conversation more than drinking, cafés are places for go-slow contemplation and camaraderie, over dusk-time borrel (&#8216;drinks&#8217;) with bar snacks or a fabulous meal any time of day. The ultimate café kick: revelling in that deliciously snug, Dutch state of gezelligheid (conviviality, cosiness) in a timeless bruin café (brown cafe), named for the nicotine stains of centuries past.</p>

<h5><strong>Landscapes</strong></h5>
<p>Geography plays a key role in the Netherlands&#8217; iconic landscapes. More than a quarter of the pancake-flat country is below sea level, and 20% has been reclaimed from the sea, making regimental rows of polders (areas of drained land) omnipresent. Uninterrupted North Sea winds have powered windmills since the 13th century, pumping water over the dykes, milling flour and more. Some two-thirds of the surface is devoted to agriculture, including beautiful rainbow fields of crocuses, daffodils, hyacinths and tulips that burst into flower each year between March and May. The kaleidoscope of colour is nothing short of psychedelic.</p>
