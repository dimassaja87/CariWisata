										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5><strong>Living History</strong></h5>
<p>İstanbul&#8217;s strategic location has attracted many marauding armies over the centuries. The Greeks, Romans and Venetians took turns ruling before the Ottomans stormed into town and decided to stay – physical reminders of their various tenures are found across the city. The fact that the city straddles two continents wasn&#8217;t its only drawcard – it was the final stage on the legendary Silk Road linking Asia with Europe, and many merchants who came here liked it so much that they, too, decided to stay. In so doing, they gave the city a cultural diversity that it retains to this day.</p>

<h5><strong>Art &amp; Architecture</strong></h5>
<p>The conquering armies of ancient times tended to ransack the city rather than endow it with artistic treasures, but all that changed with the Byzantines, who adorned their churches and palaces with mosaics and frescoes. Miraculously, many of these remain. Their successors, the Ottomans, were quick to launch an ambitious building program and the magnificently decorated imperial mosques that resulted are architectural triumphs that together form one of the world&#8217;s great skylines. In recent years, local banks and business dynasties have reprised the Ottomans&#8217; grand ambitions and endowed an impressive array of galleries, museums and festivals for all to enjoy.</p>
<blockquote style="text-align: center;"><p>This magical meeting place of East and West has more top-drawer attractions than it has minarets (and that&#8217;s a lot).</p></blockquote>
<h5><strong>Culinary Heritage</strong></h5>
<p>&#8216;But what about the food?&#8217; we hear you say. We&#8217;re happy to report that the city&#8217;s cuisine is as diverse as its heritage, and delicious to boot. Locals take their eating and drinking seriously – the restaurants here are the best in the country. You can eat aromatic Asian dishes or Italian classics if you so choose, but most visitors prefer to sample the succulent kebaps, flavoursome mezes and freshly caught fish that are the city&#8217;s signature dishes, washing them down with the national drink, rakı (aniseed brandy), or a glass or two of locally produced wine.</p>

<h5><strong>Local Life</strong></h5>
<p>Some ancient cities are the sum of their monuments, but İstanbul factors a lot more into the equation. Chief among its manifold attractions are the locals, who have an infectious love of life and generosity of spirit. This vibrant, inclusive and expanding community is full of people who work and party hard, treasure family and friendships, and have no problem melding tradition and modernity in their everyday lives. Joining them in their favourite haunts – çay bahçesis (tea gardens), kahvehans (coffeehouses), meyhanes (Turkish taverns) and kebapçıs (kebap restaurants) – will be a highlight of your visit.</p>
