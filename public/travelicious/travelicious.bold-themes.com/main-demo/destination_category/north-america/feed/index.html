										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5><strong>Outlandish Notions</strong></h5>
<p>Consider permission permanently granted to be outlandish: other towns may surprise you, but in San Francisco you will surprise yourself. Good times and social revolutions tend to start here, from manic gold rushes to blissful hippie be-ins. If there&#8217;s a skateboard move yet to be busted, a technology still unimagined, a poem left unspoken or a green scheme untested, chances are it&#8217;s about to happen here. Yes, right now. This town has lost almost everything in earthquakes and dot-com gambles, but never its nerve.</p>
<blockquote style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: left;">Grab your coat and a handful of glitter, and enter the land of fog and fabulousness. So long, inhibitions; hello, San Francisco.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5><strong>Food &amp; Drink</strong></h5>
<p>Every available Bay Area–invented technology is needed to make dinner decisions in this city, with the most restaurants and farmers markets per capita in North America, supplied by pioneering local organic farms. San Francisco set the gold standard for Wild West saloons, but drinking was driven underground in the 1920s with Prohibition. Today, San Francisco celebrates its speakeasies and vintage saloons – and with Wine Country and local distillers providing a steady supply of America&#8217;s finest hooch, the West remains wild.</p>

<h5><strong>Natural Highs</strong></h5>
<p>California is one grand, sweeping gesture – a long arm hugging the Pacific – and the 7-by-7-mile peninsula of San Francisco is a thumb pointed optimistically upwards. Take this as a hint to look up: you&#8217;ll notice San Francisco&#8217;s crooked Victorian rooflines, wind-sculpted treetops and fog tumbling over the Golden Gate Bridge.Heads are perpetually in the clouds atop San Francisco&#8217;s 43 hills. Cable cars provide easy access to Russian and Nob Hills, and splendid panoramas reward the slog up to Coit Tower – but the most exhilarating highs are earned on Telegraph Hill&#8217;s garden-lined stairway walks and windswept hikes around Land&#8217;s End.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2644 size-medium" src="https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-san-francisco-04-640x427.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="801" srcset="https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-san-francisco-04-640x427.jpg 640w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-san-francisco-04-1280x854.jpg 1280w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-san-francisco-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-san-francisco-04-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-san-francisco-04-800x534.jpg 800w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-san-francisco-04-320x213.jpg 320w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-san-francisco-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-san-francisco-04.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h5><strong>Neighborhood Microclimates</strong></h5>
<p>Microclimates add magic realism to San Francisco days: when it&#8217;s drizzling in the outer reaches of Golden Gate Park, it might be sunny in the Mission. A few degrees&#8217; difference between neighborhoods grants permission for salted-caramel ice cream in Dolores Park, or a hasty retreat to tropical heat inside the California Academy of Sciences&#8217; rainforest dome. This town will give you goose bumps one minute, and warm you to the core the next.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[For most, any trip to the Empire State starts or finishes in its iconic metropolis: New York City. However, if you confine your travels only to the five boroughs there's a considerable amount you're missing out on.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Long Island and upstate New York – generally accepted as anywhere north of the NYC metro area – shouldn&#8217;t be missed. Long Island has cozy beach towns, while upstate is a dream destination for those who cherish the great outdoors. The Hudson River valley acts as an escape route from the city, leading eager sojourners north. From Albany, the 524-mile Erie Canal cuts due west to Lake Erie, passing spectacular Niagara Falls, Buffalo and Rochester. In the east you&#8217;ll find the St Lawrence River and its thousands of islands, as well as the magnificent Adirondack and Catskills mountains. Head to the middle of the state and you&#8217;ll be ensconced in the serene Finger Lakes.</p>
<blockquote style="text-align: center;"><p>Epicenter of the arts. Dining and shopping capital. Trendsetter. New York City wears many crowns, and spreads an irresistible feast for all.</p></blockquote>
<h5><strong>Nexus of the Arts</strong></h5>
<p>The Met, MoMA and the Guggenheim are just the beginning of a dizzying list of art-world icons. You’ll find museums devoted to everything from fin de siècle Vienna to immigrant life in the Lower East Side, and sprawling galleries filled with Japanese sculpture, postmodern American painting, Himalayan textiles and New York City lore. For a glimpse of current and future greats, delve into the cutting-edge galleries of Chelsea and the Lower East Side, with their myriad exhibition spaces and festive opening-night parties (usually Thursday night if you want to join in).</p>

<h5><strong>Urban Wanderers</strong></h5>
<p>With its compact size and streets packed with eye candy of all sorts – architectural treasures, Old World cafes, atmospheric booksellers – NYC is a wanderer’s delight. Crossing continents is as easy as walking a few avenues in this jumbled city of 200-plus nationalities. You can lose yourself in the crowds of Chinatown amid bright Buddhist temples and steaming noodle shops, then stroll up to Nolita for enticing boutiques and coffee-tasting. Every neighborhood offers a dramatically different version of the city, from the 100-year-old Jewish delis of the Upper West Side to the meandering cobblestone lanes of Greenwich Village. And the best way to experience it is to walk its streets.</p>
<h5><strong>The Night Is Young</strong></h5>
<p>When the sun sinks slowly beyond the Hudson and luminous skyscrapers light up the night, New York transforms into one grand stage. Well-known actors take to the legendary theaters of Broadway and world-class soloists, dancers and musicians perform at venues large and small across town. Whether high culture or low, New York embraces it all: in-your-face rock shows at Williamsburg dives, lavish opera productions at the Lincoln Center, and everything in between. This is a city of experimental theater, improv comedy, indie cinema, ballet, poetry, burlesque, jazz and so much more. If you can dream it up, it’s probably happening.</p>

<h5><strong>Culinary Capital</strong></h5>
<p>There’s never been a better time to dine in New York. It&#8217;s a hotbed of seasonal and locally sourced cuisine – with restaurants growing vegetables on roof gardens or upstate farms, sourcing meats and seafood from nearby sustainable outfits, and embracing artisanal everything, from coffee roasting and whiskey distilling to chocolate- and cheese-making. Bars have also taken creativity to new heights, with pre-Prohibition-era cocktails served alongside delectable small plates – indeed, gastropubs are some of the most creative places to eat these days. Of course, you can also hit a gourmet food truck or dine at one of the 20,000-plus sit-down restaurants.</p>
<h5><strong>Brooklyn</strong></h5>
<p>Forget Times Square and the Statue of Liberty – if you want to see the real New York, you need to head to Brooklyn. These days, the name is shorthand for &#8216;artsy cool&#8217; the world over, but there&#8217;s far more here than hipster stereotypes. This sprawling borough (more than three times the size of Manhattan) is actually home to some of NYC&#8217;s most interesting, historic and culturally diverse neighborhoods, with singularly fantastic dining, drinking, shopping and entertainment options – not to mention some of the best river views in the five boroughs.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Scented by slow-roasted pork and sea breezes, and colored by swashbuckling history, this sun-washed medley of Spanish and American influences is a paradise-seeker's pleasure dome.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5><strong>Hurricane Maria and Puerto Rico</strong></h5>
<p>In early September 2017, Puerto Rico anxiously prepared for two catastrophic hurricanes that threatened its shores. Hurricane Irma came first, wrecking the islands of Culebra and Vieques and causing serious damage and flooding along the country’s northeastern coast. Just a week later, Hurricane Maria made a more direct impact, becoming the strongest hurricane to hit Puerto Rico in 89 years. While Maria&#8217;s blow may have immobilized the island temporarily, Puerto Ricans continue to persevere as relief efforts mobilize and recovery begins. Borinquen has weathered many storms, and it will weather this one too.</p>
<h5><strong>Caribbean Beaches</strong></h5>
<p>Puerto Rico inspires Caribbean daydreams for good reason: it can satisfy both the lethargic beach bum and the budding big-wave surfer – all in a long weekend. Its coral reefs host a riot of fantastical fish and the shores shimmer like crushed pearls. On some beaches you&#8217;ll have plenty of company. In other places like Vieques or Cabo Rojo you might have some of the world&#8217;s best stretches of sand entirely to yourself. If the sands that rim the island tempt you to stay, you can opt for sizeable resorts or independent guesthouses for watching those seaside sunsets from your room.</p>
<blockquote style="text-align: center;"><p>Scented by slow-roasted pork and sea breezes, and colored by swashbuckling history, this sun-washed medley of Spanish and American influences is a paradise-seeker&#8217;s pleasure dome.</p></blockquote>
<h5><strong>Cultural Vibrancy</strong></h5>
<p>The island&#8217;s culture is of the visceral kind. You&#8217;ll need to search for it beyond the condo towers and congested roads, and sometimes it seems Puerto Rico does not wish to show outsiders its cultural magnitude. Then, suddenly, you&#8217;ll smell it in the smoke arising from lechoneras (eateries specializing in suckling pig), or hear it in the intoxicating patters of salsa beats. You&#8217;ll glimpse it as sunlight sparkles across coffee plantations, or in museums celebrating everything from failed revolution to classical European painting. Puerto Rican traditions have been shaped by generations of cultural synthesis, celebration and setback, and it emerges today as vivid and indomitable.</p>
<h5><strong>Happening History</strong></h5>
<p>Puerto Rico&#8217;s present appears laid-back but its past brims with cannon fire and colonization, repression and revolt. Legend abounds: from San Juan&#8217;s fortresses, scoured by siege, to the crumbling South Coast sugar refineries once powering the island&#8217;s economy. European settlers built pretty plazas in harbor cities while political revolutionaries schemed rebellion in mountain villages. History enthusiasts can wander precolonial Taíno ruins or coffee haciendas. Even if your interest is scant, it&#8217;s hard not to get immersed in Puerto Rico&#8217;s tempestuous story in Old San Juan, where enticing echoes of bygone times – of colonists and swashbucklers and smugglers – reverberate still.</p>
<h5><strong>Forest Thrills</strong></h5>
<p>Even those who stick to the coast cannot escape the alluring shadow of Puerto Rico&#8217;s thick forests, as knotted labyrinths of mangroves create crucial shoreside wildlife reserves and the green glint of the inland forested hills is rarely out of sight.The island&#8217;s dense foliage invites a perpetual mystery to blanket it, as coqui frogs chant among giant tree ferns and roots reduce so-called roads to rubble. The forests here are internationally important, such as El Yunque, the only tropical rainforest in the US. A journey into them guarantees to awaken the adventurer within.</p>
