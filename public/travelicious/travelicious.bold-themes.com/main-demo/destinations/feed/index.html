										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5><strong>Outlandish Notions</strong></h5>
<p>Consider permission permanently granted to be outlandish: other towns may surprise you, but in San Francisco you will surprise yourself. Good times and social revolutions tend to start here, from manic gold rushes to blissful hippie be-ins. If there&#8217;s a skateboard move yet to be busted, a technology still unimagined, a poem left unspoken or a green scheme untested, chances are it&#8217;s about to happen here. Yes, right now. This town has lost almost everything in earthquakes and dot-com gambles, but never its nerve.</p>
<blockquote style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: left;">Grab your coat and a handful of glitter, and enter the land of fog and fabulousness. So long, inhibitions; hello, San Francisco.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5><strong>Food &amp; Drink</strong></h5>
<p>Every available Bay Area–invented technology is needed to make dinner decisions in this city, with the most restaurants and farmers markets per capita in North America, supplied by pioneering local organic farms. San Francisco set the gold standard for Wild West saloons, but drinking was driven underground in the 1920s with Prohibition. Today, San Francisco celebrates its speakeasies and vintage saloons – and with Wine Country and local distillers providing a steady supply of America&#8217;s finest hooch, the West remains wild.</p>

<h5><strong>Natural Highs</strong></h5>
<p>California is one grand, sweeping gesture – a long arm hugging the Pacific – and the 7-by-7-mile peninsula of San Francisco is a thumb pointed optimistically upwards. Take this as a hint to look up: you&#8217;ll notice San Francisco&#8217;s crooked Victorian rooflines, wind-sculpted treetops and fog tumbling over the Golden Gate Bridge.Heads are perpetually in the clouds atop San Francisco&#8217;s 43 hills. Cable cars provide easy access to Russian and Nob Hills, and splendid panoramas reward the slog up to Coit Tower – but the most exhilarating highs are earned on Telegraph Hill&#8217;s garden-lined stairway walks and windswept hikes around Land&#8217;s End.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2644 size-medium" src="https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-san-francisco-04-640x427.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="801" srcset="https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-san-francisco-04-640x427.jpg 640w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-san-francisco-04-1280x854.jpg 1280w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-san-francisco-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-san-francisco-04-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-san-francisco-04-800x534.jpg 800w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-san-francisco-04-320x213.jpg 320w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-san-francisco-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-san-francisco-04.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h5><strong>Neighborhood Microclimates</strong></h5>
<p>Microclimates add magic realism to San Francisco days: when it&#8217;s drizzling in the outer reaches of Golden Gate Park, it might be sunny in the Mission. A few degrees&#8217; difference between neighborhoods grants permission for salted-caramel ice cream in Dolores Park, or a hasty retreat to tropical heat inside the California Academy of Sciences&#8217; rainforest dome. This town will give you goose bumps one minute, and warm you to the core the next.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Zagreb is made for strolling. Wander through the Upper Town's red-roof and cobblestone glory, peppered with church spires. Crane your neck to see the domes and ornate upper-floor frippery of the Lower Town's mash-up of secessionist, neo-baroque and art deco buildings.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Search out the grittier pockets of town where ugly-bland concrete walls have been transformed into colourful murals by local street artists. This city rewards those on foot.</p>
<blockquote style="text-align: center;"><p>If your Mediterranean fantasies feature balmy days by sapphire waters in the shade of ancient walled towns, Croatia is the place to turn into reality.</p></blockquote>
<p>Afterwards, do as the locals do and head to a cafe. The cafe-culture here is just one facet of this city&#8217;s vibrant street life, egged on by a year-round swag of events that bring music, pop-up markets and food stalls to the plazas and parks. Even when there&#8217;s nothing on, the centre thrums with youthful energy so it&#8217;s no surprise that Croatia&#8217;s capital is now bringing in the city-break crowd. Zagreb is the little city that could.</p>

<h5><strong>Beauty on the Inside</strong></h5>
<p>Shift your gaze for just a moment from the glittering waters and chances are an almighty mountain will loom into view. The Dinaric Alps, which stretch all the way from Italy to Albania, hug much of the coast. The limestone karst has bequeathed a wonderland of craggy peaks, caverns, river canyons, waterfalls and ridiculously picturesque lakes. Head further inland and things flatten out again into rolling farmland. Active types will find plenty of chances to get among it on the numerous hiking and biking trails, while the more adventurous can have a go at rock climbing, rafting and zip-lining.</p>

<h5><strong>Cultural Feast</strong></h5>
<p>If you&#8217;re lucky enough to cross the tourist/guest barrier and be invited into a local&#8217;s home, you&#8217;ll soon become acquainted with the refrain &#8216;Jedi! Jedi! Jedi!&#8217; (Eat! Eat! Eat!). Sharing food and drink plays a big part in the culture here, which speaks both to the nature of Croatian hospitality and to the quality of local produce. Simple home-style cooking is a feature of family-run taverns, but increasingly a new breed of chefs are bringing a more adventurous approach to the table. Meanwhile, Croatian wines and olive oils are making their mark on the world stage, garnering top awards.</p>

Deeper in Belgrade&#8217;s bowels are museums guarding the cultural, religious and military heritage of the country. &#8216;Belgrade&#8217; translates as &#8216;White City&#8217;, but Serbia&#8217;s capital is red hot.</span></p>

After this tour you will feel yourself more of a Serbian Expert! The tour starts at prominent Republic Square blow the Big Clock in Belgrade’s downtown at 10:00 am. First we will start with a morning coffee in a local charming café at Cara Dušana Street in famous Dorćol quarter. Coffee drinking is a ritual for locals that lets them enjoy a cup of energizing coffee and dynamic chitchat. At the coffee bar you will enjoy some good quality coffee prepared in Serbian manner and, in case you like it, purchase some for warming memories!</p>
<p>Here you will hear story how coffee was brought to Belgrade and how this ritual became a solution for every private or business challenge. After getting a dose of caffeine you will be ready to research one of the oldest green markets in Belgrade, known as Bajloni market even though its official name is Skadarska Market. On the way to market, you will stop by in a bakery to purchase some bruschetta for upcoming cheese-tasting on the market.</p>

When you get to the Bajloni market, you will feel the taste of rural Serbia: villages where these dairy products are produced and where the fresh vegetables and fruits are grown. Markets in Belgrade are kinda live social networks where you can get well informed about all daily happenings.</p>
<p>You will, of course, get informed on how the first market in Belgrade was set.

Here you will enjoy an 8-course lunch enriched with chef’s story about ingredients and preparation. It is quite an experience letting you learn about new trends in organic agriculture and development of national cuisine. After the lunch you will better understand rhythm of Belgrade.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5><strong>Kremlin &amp; Red Square</strong></h5>
<p>The very founding site of the city (and arguably, the country), the Kremlin and Red Square are still at the heart of Moscow – historically, geographically and spiritually. Feel the weight of this significance as you wander within the walls of the ancient fortress, marvel at the mind-boggling magnificence of St Basil&#8217;s Cathedral and pay your respects to the revered leader of a now-defunct state. Moscow will move you. It will tantalise your senses, soothe your spirit and boggle your mind – and it all starts right here at the Kremlin and Red Square.</p>

<h5><strong>Communist History</strong></h5>
<p>The remains of the Soviet state are scattered all around the city. Monuments remember fallen heroes and victorious battles, while museums attempt to analyse and synthesise the past. See Lenin and Stalin – off their pedestals – at the whimsical Art Muzeon. Step into the socialist-realist fantasy at VDNKh. Descend into the depths of the Soviet system at Bunker-42 Cold War Museum. Ride the museum-like metro and remember the millions who suffered at the Gulag History Museum. Nowadays, retro clubs and cafes give their guests a taste of the Soviet experience. You can even try your hand at Soviet-era arcade games.</p>
<blockquote style="text-align: center;"><p>As you leave Moscow, the fast-paced modern capital fades from view and the slower-paced, old-fashioned countryside unfolds around you.</p></blockquote>
<h5><strong>Performing Arts</strong></h5>
<p>What is more thrilling than watching a ballerina defy gravity, leaping across the stage at the glittering Bolshoi Theatre? Or feeling the force of Tchaikovsky&#8217;s 1812 Overture, just a few blocks away from where it premiered more than a century ago? Or oohing and aahing as circus performers soar under the big tent? The classical performing arts in Moscow are still among the best in the world. Nowadays, even the most traditional theatres are experimenting with innovative arrangements, reviving lost favourites and hosting world premieres. Whether you appreciate the classics or prefer the contemporary, the capital&#8217;s performing arts will impress.</p>

<h5><strong>Orthodoxy &amp; Architecture</strong></h5>
<p>At nearly every turn in Moscow, you&#8217;ll see golden domes peeking out over the rooftops and hear church bells peeling through the streets, which are dotted with some 600 churches – many of which are glittering after recent renovations. There are colourful hidden gems, historic fortresses and gargantuan cathedrals. The exteriors are adorned with stone carvings and glittering domes; interiors are packed with ancient icons, swirling incense and faithful worshippers. For more than a millennium, Orthodoxy has helped to define the Russian nation, a significance that is palpable in these atmospheric spiritual places.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Tokyo&#8217;s neon-lit streetscapes still look like a sci-fi film set – and that&#8217;s a vision of the city from the 1980s. Tokyo has been building ever since, pushing the boundaries of what&#8217;s possible on densely populated, earthquake-prone land, adding ever taller, sleeker structures. Come see the utopian mega-malls, the edgy designer boutiques from Japan&#8217;s award-winning architects, and the world&#8217;s tallest tower – Tokyo Sky Tree – a twisting spire that draws on ancient building techniques. Stand atop one of Tokyo&#8217;s skyscrapers and look out over the city at night to see it blinking like the control panel of a starship, stretching all the way to the horizon.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Tokyo may be forever reaching into the future but you can still see traces of the shogun&#8217;s capital on the kabuki stage, at a sumo tournament or under the cherry blossoms. It&#8217;s a modern city built on old patterns, and in the shadows of skyscrapers you can find anachronistic wooden shanty bars and quiet alleys, raucous traditional festivals and lantern-lit yakitori (grilled chicken) stands. In older neighbourhoods you can shop for handicrafts made just as they have been for centuries, or wander down cobblestone lanes where geisha once trod.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Yes, Tokyo has more Michelin stars than any other city. Yes, Japanese cuisine has been added to the Unesco Intangible Cultural Heritage list. But that&#8217;s not what makes dining in Tokyo such an amazing experience. What really counts is the city&#8217;s long-standing artisan culture. You can splash out on the best sushi of your life, made by one of the city&#8217;s legendary chefs using the freshest, seasonal market ingredients. You can also spend ¥800 on a bowl of noodles made with the same care and exacting attention to detail, from a recipe honed through decades of experience.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">From giant robots to saucer-eyed schoolgirls to a certain, ubiquitous kitty, Japanese pop culture is a phenomenon that has reached far around the world. Tokyo is the country&#8217;s pop-culture laboratory, where new trends grow legs. Come see the latest looks bubbling out of the backstreets of Harajuku, the hottest pop stars projected on the giant video screens in Shibuya, or the newest anime and manga flying off the shelves in Akihabara. Gawk at the giant statues of Godzilla; shop for your favourite character goods; or pick up some style inspiration just walking down the street.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Long Island and upstate New York – generally accepted as anywhere north of the NYC metro area – shouldn&#8217;t be missed. Long Island has cozy beach towns, while upstate is a dream destination for those who cherish the great outdoors. The Hudson River valley acts as an escape route from the city, leading eager sojourners north. From Albany, the 524-mile Erie Canal cuts due west to Lake Erie, passing spectacular Niagara Falls, Buffalo and Rochester. In the east you&#8217;ll find the St Lawrence River and its thousands of islands, as well as the magnificent Adirondack and Catskills mountains. Head to the middle of the state and you&#8217;ll be ensconced in the serene Finger Lakes.</p>
<blockquote style="text-align: center;"><p>Epicenter of the arts. Dining and shopping capital. Trendsetter. New York City wears many crowns, and spreads an irresistible feast for all.</p></blockquote>
<h5><strong>Nexus of the Arts</strong></h5>
<p>The Met, MoMA and the Guggenheim are just the beginning of a dizzying list of art-world icons. You’ll find museums devoted to everything from fin de siècle Vienna to immigrant life in the Lower East Side, and sprawling galleries filled with Japanese sculpture, postmodern American painting, Himalayan textiles and New York City lore. For a glimpse of current and future greats, delve into the cutting-edge galleries of Chelsea and the Lower East Side, with their myriad exhibition spaces and festive opening-night parties (usually Thursday night if you want to join in).</p>

<h5><strong>Urban Wanderers</strong></h5>
<p>With its compact size and streets packed with eye candy of all sorts – architectural treasures, Old World cafes, atmospheric booksellers – NYC is a wanderer’s delight. Crossing continents is as easy as walking a few avenues in this jumbled city of 200-plus nationalities. You can lose yourself in the crowds of Chinatown amid bright Buddhist temples and steaming noodle shops, then stroll up to Nolita for enticing boutiques and coffee-tasting. Every neighborhood offers a dramatically different version of the city, from the 100-year-old Jewish delis of the Upper West Side to the meandering cobblestone lanes of Greenwich Village. And the best way to experience it is to walk its streets.</p>
<h5><strong>The Night Is Young</strong></h5>
<p>When the sun sinks slowly beyond the Hudson and luminous skyscrapers light up the night, New York transforms into one grand stage. Well-known actors take to the legendary theaters of Broadway and world-class soloists, dancers and musicians perform at venues large and small across town. Whether high culture or low, New York embraces it all: in-your-face rock shows at Williamsburg dives, lavish opera productions at the Lincoln Center, and everything in between. This is a city of experimental theater, improv comedy, indie cinema, ballet, poetry, burlesque, jazz and so much more. If you can dream it up, it’s probably happening.</p>

<h5><strong>Culinary Capital</strong></h5>
<p>There’s never been a better time to dine in New York. It&#8217;s a hotbed of seasonal and locally sourced cuisine – with restaurants growing vegetables on roof gardens or upstate farms, sourcing meats and seafood from nearby sustainable outfits, and embracing artisanal everything, from coffee roasting and whiskey distilling to chocolate- and cheese-making. Bars have also taken creativity to new heights, with pre-Prohibition-era cocktails served alongside delectable small plates – indeed, gastropubs are some of the most creative places to eat these days. Of course, you can also hit a gourmet food truck or dine at one of the 20,000-plus sit-down restaurants.</p>
<h5><strong>Brooklyn</strong></h5>
<p>Forget Times Square and the Statue of Liberty – if you want to see the real New York, you need to head to Brooklyn. These days, the name is shorthand for &#8216;artsy cool&#8217; the world over, but there&#8217;s far more here than hipster stereotypes. This sprawling borough (more than three times the size of Manhattan) is actually home to some of NYC&#8217;s most interesting, historic and culturally diverse neighborhoods, with singularly fantastic dining, drinking, shopping and entertainment options – not to mention some of the best river views in the five boroughs.</p>

<p>Barcelona&#8217;s architectural treasures span 2000-plus years. Towering temple columns, ancient city walls and subterranean stone corridors provide a window into Roman-era Barcino. Fast forward a thousand years or so to the Middle Ages by taking a stroll through the shadowy lanes of the Gothic quarter, past tranquil plazas and soaring 14th-century cathedrals.</p>
<p>In other parts of town bloom the sculptural masterpieces of Modernisme, a mix of ingenious and whimsical creations by Gaudí and his Catalan architectural contemporaries. Barcelona has also long inspired artists, including Pablo Picasso and Joan Miró, both of whom have major Barcelona museums devoted to their works.</p>
<h5><strong>A Moveable Feast</strong></h5>
<p>The masters of molecular gastronomy – Albert Adrià, Carles Abellan et al – are part of the long and celebrated tradition of Catalan cooking. Simple, flavourful ingredients – seafood, jamón (cured ham), market-fresh produce – are transformed into remarkable delicacies and then served in captivating settings.</p>
<p>Feast on hearty, rich paella at an outdoor table overlooking the sea or step back to the 1920s at an elegant art nouveau dining room. Barcelona&#8217;s wide-ranging palate adds further complexity: Basque-style tapas bars, Galician seafood taverns, avant-garde Japanese restaurants and sinful chocolate shops are all essential parts of the culinary landscape.</p>

<p>The deep blue Mediterranean beckons. Sun-drenched beaches make a fine backdrop to a jog, bike ride or long leisurely stroll along the seaside – followed by a refreshing dip. You can also enjoy the view from out on the water while kayaking, stand-up paddleboarding or taking it easy on a sunset cruise.</p>
<p>Looming behind the city, the rolling forest-covered Collserola hills provide a scenic setting for hiking, mountain biking or just admiring the view. Closer to the city centre, hilltop Montjuïc offers endless exploring amid botanic and sculpture gardens, an old castle and first-rate museums with panoramic views at every turn.</p>
<h5><strong>Twenty-four-hour Party People</strong></h5>
<p>The night holds limitless possibilities in Barcelona. Start with sunset drinks on a panoramic terrace or dig your heels in the sand at a rustic beachside chiringuito (bar). As darkness falls, live music transforms the city: the rapid-fire rhythms of flamenco, brassy jazz spilling out of basements, and hands-in-the-air indie-rock at vintage concert halls.</p>
<p>Towards midnight the bars fill. Take your pick from old-school taverns adorned with 19th-century murals, plush lounges in lamp-lit medieval chambers or boisterous cava bars. If you&#8217;re still standing at 3am, hit the clubs and explore Barcelona&#8217;s unabashed wild side.</p>

<p>Immersed in history, London&#8217;s rich seams of eye-opening antiquity are everywhere. The city&#8217;s buildings are striking milestones in a unique and beguiling biography, and a great many of them – the Tower of London, Westminster Abbey, Big Ben – are instantly recognisable landmarks. There’s more than enough innovation (the Shard, the Tate Modern extension, the planned Garden Bridge) to put a crackle in the air, but it never drowns out London’s seasoned, centuries-old narrative. Architectural grandeur rises up all around you in the West End, ancient remains dot the City and charming pubs punctuate the historic quarters, leafy suburbs and river banks. Take your pick.</p>
<blockquote style="text-align: center;"><p>A bad day in London is still better than a good day anywhere else.</p></blockquote>
<h5><strong>Art &amp; Culture</strong></h5>
<p>A tireless innovator of art and culture, London is a city of ideas and the imagination. Londoners have always been fiercely independent thinkers (and critics), but until not so long ago people were suspicious of anything they considered avant-garde. That’s in the past now, and the city’s creative milieu is streaked with left-field attitude, whether it&#8217;s theatrical innovation, contemporary art, pioneering music, writing, poetry, architecture or design. Food is another creative arena that has become a tireless obsession in certain circles.</p>

<p>This city is deeply multicultural, with one in three Londoners foreign-born, representing 270 nationalities and 300 tongues. Britain may have voted for Brexit (although the majority of Londoners didn&#8217;t), but for now London remains one of the world&#8217;s most cosmopolitan cities, and diversity infuses daily life, food, music and fashion. It even penetrates intrinsically British institutions; the British Museum and Victoria &amp; Albert Museum have collections as varied as they are magnificent, while the flavours at centuries-old Borough Market run the full global gourmet spectrum.</p>
</div><div class="bt_bb_separator bt_bb_border_style_none bt_bb_bottom_spacing_normal" data-bt-override-class="null"></div><div class="bt_bb_masonry_image_grid bt_bb_grid_container bt_bb_columns_1 bt_bb_gap_normal" data-columns="1"><div class="bt_bb_masonry_post_image_content" data-columns="1"><div class="bt_bb_grid_sizer"></div><div class="bt_bb_grid_item bt_bb_tile_format11" data-hw="0.6675" data-src="https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-london-02-1280x854.jpg" data-src-full="https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-london-02.jpg" data-title="destination-london-02"><div class="bt_bb_grid_item_inner" data-hw="0.6675" ><div class="bt_bb_grid_item_inner_image"></div><div class="bt_bb_grid_item_inner_content"></div></div></div></div></div><div class="bt_bb_separator bt_bb_border_style_none bt_bb_bottom_spacing_normal" data-bt-override-class="null"></div><div  class="bt_bb_text" ><h5><strong>A Tale of Two Cities</strong></h5>
<p>London is as much about wide-open vistas and leafy landscape escapes as it is high-density, sight-packed urban exploration. Central London is where the major museums, galleries and most iconic sights congregate, but visit Hampstead Heath or the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park to flee the crowds and frolic in wide open green expanses. You can also venture further out to Kew Gardens, Richmond or Hampton Court Palace for beautiful panoramas of riverside London followed by a pint in a quiet waterside pub.</p>

<p>Bismarck and Marx, Einstein and Hitler, JFK and Bowie, they’ve all shaped – and been shaped by – Berlin, whose richly textured history confronts you at every turn. This is a city that staged a revolution, was headquartered by Nazis, bombed to bits, divided in two and finally reunited – and that was just in the 20th century! Walk along remnants of the Berlin Wall, marvel at the splendour of a Prussian palace, visit Checkpoint Charlie or stand in the very room where the Holocaust was planned. Berlin is like an endlessly fascinating 3D textbook where the past is very much present wherever you go.</p>

<p>Forget about New York – Berlin is the city that truly never sleeps. Sometimes it seems as though Berliners are the lotus-eaters of Germany, people who love nothing more than a good time. The city&#8217;s vast party spectrum caters for every taste, budget and age group. From tiny basement clubs to industrial techno temples, chestnut-canopied beer gardens to fancy cocktail caverns, saucy cabarets to ear-pleasing symphonies – Berlin delivers hot-stepping odysseys, and not just after dark and on weekends but pretty much 24/7. Pack your stamina!</p>

<p>When it comes to creativity, the sky’s the limit in Berlin, which is one of Europe&#8217;s big start-up capitals. In the last 20 years, the city has become a giant lab of cultural experimentation thanks to a spirit that nurtures and encourages new ideas as well as to once abundant space and cheap rent. Although the last two of these are definitely a thing of the past. Top international performers still grace Berlin&#8217;s theatre, concert and opera stages; international art-world stars like Olafur Eliasson and Jonathan Meese make their home here; and Clooney and Hanks shoot blockbusters in the German capital. Highbrow, lowbrow and everything in between – there’s plenty of room for the full gamut of cultural expression.</p>

<p>Berlin is a big multicultural metropolis but deep down it maintains the unpretentious charm of an international village. Locals and expats follow the credo &#8216;live and let live&#8217; and put greater emphasis on personal freedom and a creative lifestyle than on material wealth and status symbols. Cafes are jammed at all hours, drinking is a religious rite and clubs keep going through the weekend into Monday. Size-wise, Berlin is pretty big but its key areas are wonderfully compact and easily navigated on foot, by bike or with public transport.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[São Paulo is a monster. Enormous, intimidating and, at first glance at least, no great beauty. It's a difficult city for the traveler to master and one that may not seem worth the sweat.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even the most partisan Paulistano – resident of São Paulo city – will rail about the smog, the traffic, the crumbling sidewalks and the gaping divide between poor and rich.<br />
But in the same breath they’ll tell you they’d never live anywhere else. Let them guide you to their favorite haunts and the reason for this will begin to unfold. Maybe they will introduce you to the city’s innumerable art-house cinemas and experimental theaters. If they’re gourmands, you’ll focus on the smart bistros and gourmet restaurants that make the city a world-renowned foodie haven. If they’re scenesters, double up on espresso before embarking on a tour of raucous underground bars and the 24/7 clubbing scene.</p>
<blockquote style="text-align: center;"><p>Whatever pleasures you might covet, Sampa – as the city is known – probably has them in spades.</p></blockquote>
<p>This fertile cultural life is supported by Brazil’s biggest and best-educated middle class and further enriched by literally hundreds of distinct ethnic groups – including the largest community of people of Japanese descent outside Japan, the largest population of Italian descendants outside Italy and a significant Arab community fueled mostly by Lebanese and Syrian immigration. There are one million people of German stock, as well, sizable Chinese, Armenian, Lithuanian, Greek, Korean, Polish and Hungarian communities; and, most recently, growing numbers of Peruvians, Bolivians, Haitians and Africans. São Paulo also has the largest openly gay community in Latin America.</p>

<p>An estimated 20 million people live in greater São Paulo, making it the third-largest metropolis on earth. Besides a dizzying avalanche of first-rate museums, cultural centers, experimental theaters and cinemas, Sampa’s nightclubs and bars are among the best on the continent (15,000 bars make for one hell of a pub crawl) and its restaurants are among the world&#8217;s best. Its relentless, round-the-clock pulse – a close cousin of New York or Tokyo – can prove taxing even for the fiercest hipster. Then again, it may just deliver the charge you need to discover one of the world’s great cities.</p>
