										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paris, France&#8217;s capital, is a major European city and a global center for art, fashion, gastronomy and culture. Its 19th-century cityscape is crisscrossed by wide boulevards and the River Seine. Beyond such landmarks as the Eiffel Tower and the 12th-century, Gothic Notre-Dame cathedral, the city is known for its cafe culture and designer boutiques along the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré.</p>
<h5><strong>Why Our Insiders Chose This Tour</strong></h5>
<p>This Eiffel Tower experience includes summit access, allowing you to go right to the top after exploring the second floor. When you board the elevator for the summit, be sure to hit record on your mobile for a dizzying video of the view and ironwork.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast.<br />
<cite>Ernest Hemingway</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>Bypass the long lines at the Eiffel Tower with this 1-hour tour accompanied by a host, including summit access. After fast track, skip-the-line access, proceed to the second level to survey the city from the viewing platforms while listening to commentary about Paris culture, traditions, and history. Then, proceed to the summit to see Gustave Eiffel&#8217;s private apartments and sip Champagne from the onsite bar (own expense).</p>

<h5><strong>What You Can Expect</strong></h5>
<p>Choose an entry time when booking; meet your host near the Eiffel Tower a half hour prior to your scheduled time. With your group, stroll the short distance to one of the world&#8217;s busiest monuments. Bypass the long lines and head straight for the elevators, enjoying speedy and stress-free access to the second floor. Step out with your host to take in some of the best panoramic views in Paris from the viewing platform, 375 feet (114 meters) above the ground.</p>
<p>Get a basic orientation to the sights and landmarks visible from your vantage point from your host, then explore the area at your leisure. Snap photos of the Louvre, Les Invalides, Sacré Coeur, Notre Dame Cathedral, and the Champ de Mars, among other standout Parisian highlights. After you&#8217;ve had your fill of the second level, proceed to the summit, where you can toast your trip with Champagne from the bar and view Gustave Eiffel&#8217;s private apartments.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bellagio is a village on a promontory jutting out into Lake Como, in Italy. It’s known for its cobbled lanes, elegant buildings and Villa Serbelloni Park, an 18th-century terraced garden with lake views. Nearby are the Tower of the Arts, a venue for exhibitions and performances, and the Romanesque San Giacomo Church. Close to rocky Loppia Beach, the Museum of Navigational Instruments displays sundials and compasses.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Experience the dramatic beauty of the Italian Lakes on this day tour from Milan. You will visit Lake Como which is the most scenic of the three Italian lakes.</p>
<p>All the towns that lie on the banks of Lake Como enjoy breathtaking scenery of the Alps and the aqua-blue waters of Lake Como. You will see wonderful old villas and gardens with plenty of flowers and exotic plants. Como gained world fame in the 20th century thanks to the novel ‘The Betrothed’, by Alessandro Manzoni, set on the Lecco branch of the Lake.</p>
<blockquote><p>You can&#8217;t stand at the Bellagio and watch these seven story fountains and not go, &#8216;That&#8217;s something of extraordinary man-made beauty.<br />
<cite>Joe Carnahan</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>The tour is accompanied by an English-speaking guide, you will be taken on a coach tour to Lake Como. With a surface of 146 square metres, Lake Como is the third largest lake in Italy, after Lake Garda and Lake Maggiore. Its peculiar shape, an upturned Y, is due to its three branches: Colico, the northern branch, Lecco, the south east branch and Como, the south west branch.</p>
<p>Take a tour of the Como city centre and admire its beautiful old villas and learn about the history of Lombardy. The sites worth visiting are: silk museum, civic museum and Alessandro Volta museum.</p>
<p>Take a boat cruise on Lake Como (approximately 2 hours) to Bellagio, a commune in the province of Como. Perched at the tip of the peninsula separating the lake’s two southern arms, it is possible to get a view of the Alps across the lake. Here you will have free time to enjoy lunch. Transfer by boat from Bellagio to Cadenabbia.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Brussels is full of life, but even more so in the summer! A city bursting with energy, moving to a summer beat. Let your hair down to the tune of street entertainment and city festivals, in a setting of amazing and diverse, tiny or imposing buildings, each with their own history, and a huge amount of green spaces to sit and catch your breath.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Belgian capital is one of Europe&#8217;s lesser-known gems, yet it&#8217;s fully worth a visit. In addition to some of the best waffles and chocolates worldwide, the city boasts an amazing array of things to see and do. Not convinced? Here&#8217;s a sample of highlights.</p>
<h5><strong>French fries? Belgian fries!</strong></h5>
<p>As any Belgian will proudly tell you, they are the true inventors of the deep-fried potato. Try out the Belgian fries and decide for yourself whether the much-touted double-frying method is worth all the hype (best enjoyed together with a steaming bowl of clams, which restaurants customarily serve with a bottomless side of fries).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Prague, capital city of the Czech Republic, is bisected by the Vltava River. Nicknamed “the City of a Hundred Spires,” it's known for its Old Town Square, the heart of its historic core, with colorful baroque buildings, Gothic churches and the medieval Astronomical Clock, which gives an animated hourly show. Completed in 1402, pedestrian Charles Bridge is lined with statues of Catholic saints.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite its relatively small size, the Czech capital of Prague is jam-packed with magnificent sights, each endowed with a long and varied history. To make the most of your visit there, make sure to include these 10 attractions in your itinerary.</p>
<h5><strong>Vltava River</strong></h5>
<p>The Vltava River cuts across Prague&#8217;s centre. Jump aboard one of the many tour boats and take in the wonderful sights on both sides of the river while sipping a delicious Czech beer.</p>
<h5><strong>Charles Bridge</strong></h5>
<p>600 years old, Charles Bridge is one of Prague&#8217;s most iconic landmarks. Beautifully decorated with rows of 30 baroque-style statues, it&#8217;s a perfect spot for a romantic stroll.</p>
<h5><strong>Old Town Square</strong></h5>
<p>The Old Town Square in Prague offers a charmingly eclectic mix of architectural styles spanning several centuries – undoubtedly one of Europe&#8217;s most beautiful sights.</p>

<h5><strong>Discover Czech Beer</strong></h5>
<p>True to its reputation, Czech beer is delicious. A newcomer might be confused by the beer&#8217;s alcohol content, however. Don&#8217;t worry, the numbers given to the beers don&#8217;t indicate their alcohol percentage. They refer to the alcohol degree, which is a much more complicated factor. As a rule of thumb, 10 and 12 degrees, the most common, are equivalent to roughly 4% and 5% respectively. Some beers go all the way up to 19 degrees – that&#8217;s 8% alcohol!</p>
<h5><strong>Try a Czech Hot Dog</strong></h5>
<p>Believe it or not, one of Prague&#8217;s culinary highlights are its hot dogs. Infinitely superior to their American counterparts, these delicious sausages stuffed in French baguettes offer the best cheap lunch in town. Stalls are peppered throughout the city, just take your pick!</p>
