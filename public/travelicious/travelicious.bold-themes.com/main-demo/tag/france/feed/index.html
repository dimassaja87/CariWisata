										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paris, France&#8217;s capital, is a major European city and a global center for art, fashion, gastronomy and culture. Its 19th-century cityscape is crisscrossed by wide boulevards and the River Seine. Beyond such landmarks as the Eiffel Tower and the 12th-century, Gothic Notre-Dame cathedral, the city is known for its cafe culture and designer boutiques along the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré.</p>
<h5><strong>Why Our Insiders Chose This Tour</strong></h5>
<p>This Eiffel Tower experience includes summit access, allowing you to go right to the top after exploring the second floor. When you board the elevator for the summit, be sure to hit record on your mobile for a dizzying video of the view and ironwork.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast.<br />
<cite>Ernest Hemingway</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>Bypass the long lines at the Eiffel Tower with this 1-hour tour accompanied by a host, including summit access. After fast track, skip-the-line access, proceed to the second level to survey the city from the viewing platforms while listening to commentary about Paris culture, traditions, and history. Then, proceed to the summit to see Gustave Eiffel&#8217;s private apartments and sip Champagne from the onsite bar (own expense).</p>

<h5><strong>What You Can Expect</strong></h5>
<p>Choose an entry time when booking; meet your host near the Eiffel Tower a half hour prior to your scheduled time. With your group, stroll the short distance to one of the world&#8217;s busiest monuments. Bypass the long lines and head straight for the elevators, enjoying speedy and stress-free access to the second floor. Step out with your host to take in some of the best panoramic views in Paris from the viewing platform, 375 feet (114 meters) above the ground.</p>
<p>Get a basic orientation to the sights and landmarks visible from your vantage point from your host, then explore the area at your leisure. Snap photos of the Louvre, Les Invalides, Sacré Coeur, Notre Dame Cathedral, and the Champ de Mars, among other standout Parisian highlights. After you&#8217;ve had your fill of the second level, proceed to the summit, where you can toast your trip with Champagne from the bar and view Gustave Eiffel&#8217;s private apartments.</p>
