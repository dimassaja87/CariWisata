					<description><![CDATA[Bellagio is a village on a promontory jutting out into Lake Como, in Italy. It’s known for its cobbled lanes, elegant buildings and Villa Serbelloni Park, an 18th-century terraced garden with lake views. Nearby are the Tower of the Arts, a venue for exhibitions and performances, and the Romanesque San Giacomo Church. Close to rocky Loppia Beach, the Museum of Navigational Instruments displays sundials and compasses.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Experience the dramatic beauty of the Italian Lakes on this day tour from Milan. You will visit Lake Como which is the most scenic of the three Italian lakes.</p>
<p>All the towns that lie on the banks of Lake Como enjoy breathtaking scenery of the Alps and the aqua-blue waters of Lake Como. You will see wonderful old villas and gardens with plenty of flowers and exotic plants. Como gained world fame in the 20th century thanks to the novel ‘The Betrothed’, by Alessandro Manzoni, set on the Lecco branch of the Lake.</p>
<blockquote><p>You can&#8217;t stand at the Bellagio and watch these seven story fountains and not go, &#8216;That&#8217;s something of extraordinary man-made beauty.<br />
<cite>Joe Carnahan</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>The tour is accompanied by an English-speaking guide, you will be taken on a coach tour to Lake Como. With a surface of 146 square metres, Lake Como is the third largest lake in Italy, after Lake Garda and Lake Maggiore. Its peculiar shape, an upturned Y, is due to its three branches: Colico, the northern branch, Lecco, the south east branch and Como, the south west branch.</p>
<p>Take a tour of the Como city centre and admire its beautiful old villas and learn about the history of Lombardy. The sites worth visiting are: silk museum, civic museum and Alessandro Volta museum.</p>
<p>Take a boat cruise on Lake Como (approximately 2 hours) to Bellagio, a commune in the province of Como. Perched at the tip of the peninsula separating the lake’s two southern arms, it is possible to get a view of the Alps across the lake. Here you will have free time to enjoy lunch. Transfer by boat from Bellagio to Cadenabbia.</p>
