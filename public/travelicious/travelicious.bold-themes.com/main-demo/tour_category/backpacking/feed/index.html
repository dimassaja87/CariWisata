					<description><![CDATA[Oslo is blessed with some incredibly beautiful parks which manage, in typical Norwegian style, to straddle the line between a bucolic naturalness and well-kept grace. As soon as the sun is out this is where you'll find locals lolling, picnicking and often getting their gear off and catching some rays.]]></description>

<h3>Cultural Life</h3>
<p>Come to Oslo to pay homage to Edvard Munch and Henrik Ibsen, the city’s two most famous sons, by all means. But don’t leave without discovering something of its contemporary cultural life too. Explore one of its many museums, get to know its booming contemporary-art scene at one of its commercial galleries or just marvel at the work of its architects. You can also walk the neighbourhoods that may already be familiar via the works of Karl Ove Knausgård, whose autobiographical novel series Min Kamp are set here, along with the mean streets of Norwegian-noir crime writers Jo Nesbø and Anne Holt.</p>

<h3>Natural Pleasures</h3>
<p>Oslo&#8217;s skyline might be crowded by cranes but this rapidly growing urban metropolis is also one of the world’s most overwhelmingly green cities. It has earned the honour of being named European Green Capital for 2019, via one of the lowest carbon footprints in the world, excellent and well-patronised public transport, city planning that puts pedestrians first, and a real commitment to sustainable food production and green space. The city is blessed with a large number of bucolic parks, and the Oslofjord’s waterways and islands are just minutes away from the centre, as are the ski slopes and forests of Nordmarka.</p>

<h3>Culinary Capital</h3>
<p>Once known only for hot dogs and high prices, Oslo’s culinary scene is currently enjoying a Neo Nordic moment in the sun, and has become a culinary destination in its own right. This delicious change takes in everything from the most northern three-Michelin-starred restaurant in the world (Maaemo) to its deservedly hyped neighbourhood coffee scene to fabulous fusion (Icelandic-Korean is the hottest ticket in town) to the celebration of traditional favourites such as peel-and-eat shrimp, and, yes, even polse (hot dogs). The city also has a penchant for sushi and pizza, both of which can now compete on the world stage.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2951 size-medium" src="https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-oslo-04-640x427.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="801" srcset="https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-oslo-04-640x427.jpg 640w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-oslo-04-1280x854.jpg 1280w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-oslo-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-oslo-04-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-oslo-04-800x534.jpg 800w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-oslo-04-320x213.jpg 320w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-oslo-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-oslo-04.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3>Cracking Nightlife</h3>
<p>Has Oslo become Scandinavia&#8217;s late-night party hot spot? Wander Møllegata on a, well, Wednesday and you might be convinced it is. Whether it&#8217;s working your way through a list of the latest natural wine from Burgenland or Sicily, getting your hands in the air with local DJ acts such as Lindstøm and Prins Thomas or an international indie band, drinking a local beer over a game of shuffleboard or sipping cocktails made from foraged spruce or Arctic seaweed, you&#8217;ll notice that, with a grungier, wilder, realer edge than Copenhagen or Stockholm, this is certainly a city that knows how to have fun.</p>

<h3>Architecture of the Ages</h3>
<p>Barcelona&#8217;s architectural treasures span 2000-plus years. Towering temple columns, ancient city walls and subterranean stone corridors provide a window into Roman-era Barcino. Fast forward a thousand years or so to the Middle Ages by taking a stroll through the shadowy lanes of the Gothic quarter, past tranquil plazas and soaring 14th-century cathedrals. In other parts of town bloom the sculptural masterpieces of Modernisme, a mix of ingenious and whimsical creations by Gaudí and his Catalan architectural contemporaries. Barcelona has also long inspired artists, including Pablo Picasso and Joan Miró, both of whom have major Barcelona museums devoted to their works.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2664" src="http://travelicious.omnicom-dev.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2018/09/destination-barcelona-03-1280x854.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="801" srcset="https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-barcelona-03-1280x854.jpg 1280w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-barcelona-03-640x427.jpg 640w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-barcelona-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-barcelona-03-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-barcelona-03-800x534.jpg 800w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-barcelona-03-320x213.jpg 320w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-barcelona-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-barcelona-03.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3>A Moveable Feast</h3>
<p>The masters of molecular gastronomy – Albert Adrià, Carles Abellan et al – are part of the long and celebrated tradition of Catalan cooking. Simple, flavourful ingredients – seafood, jamón (cured ham), market-fresh produce – are transformed into remarkable delicacies and then served in captivating settings. Feast on hearty, rich paella at an outdoor table overlooking the sea or step back to the 1920s at an elegant art nouveau dining room. Barcelona&#8217;s wide-ranging palate adds further complexity: Basque-style tapas bars, Galician seafood taverns, avant-garde Japanese restaurants and sinful chocolate shops are all essential parts of the culinary landscape.</p>
<h3>Under the Iberian Sun</h3>
<p>The deep blue Mediterranean beckons. Sun-drenched beaches make a fine backdrop to a jog, bike ride or long leisurely stroll along the seaside – followed by a refreshing dip. You can also enjoy the view from out on the water while kayaking, stand-up paddleboarding or taking it easy on a sunset cruise. Looming behind the city, the rolling forest-covered Collserola hills provide a scenic setting for hiking, mountain biking or just admiring the view. Closer to the city centre, hilltop Montjuïc offers endless exploring amid botanic and sculpture gardens, an old castle and first-rate museums with panoramic views at every turn.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2665" src="http://travelicious.omnicom-dev.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2018/09/destination-barcelona-04-1280x854.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="801" srcset="https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-barcelona-04-1280x854.jpg 1280w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-barcelona-04-640x427.jpg 640w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-barcelona-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-barcelona-04-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-barcelona-04-800x534.jpg 800w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-barcelona-04-320x213.jpg 320w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-barcelona-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-barcelona-04.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3>Twenty-four-hour Party People</h3>
<p>The night holds limitless possibilities in Barcelona. Start with sunset drinks on a panoramic terrace or dig your heels in the sand at a rustic beachside chiringuito (bar). As darkness falls, live music transforms the city: the rapid-fire rhythms of flamenco, brassy jazz spilling out of basements, and hands-in-the-air indie-rock at vintage concert halls. Towards midnight the bars fill. Take your pick from old-school taverns adorned with 19th-century murals, plush lounges in lamp-lit medieval chambers or boisterous cava bars. If you&#8217;re still standing at 3am, hit the clubs and explore Barcelona&#8217;s unabashed wild side.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Epic Grandeur</h3>
<p>Never was a thoroughfare so aptly named as the Grand Canal, reflecting the glories of Venetian architecture lining its banks. At the end of Venice’s signature waterway, the Palazzo Ducale and Basilica di San Marco add double exclamation points. But wait until you see what’s hiding in the narrow backstreets: neighbourhood churches lined with Veroneses and priceless marbles, Tiepolo’s glimpses of heaven on homeless-shelter ceilings, and a single Titian painting that mysteriously lights up an entire basilica.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2977" src="http://travelicious.omnicom-dev.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2018/09/tour-venice-02-1280x854.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="801" srcset="https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-venice-02-1280x854.jpg 1280w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-venice-02-640x427.jpg 640w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-venice-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-venice-02-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-venice-02-800x534.jpg 800w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-venice-02-320x213.jpg 320w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-venice-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-venice-02.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3>Venetian Feasts</h3>
<p>Garden islands and lagoon aquaculture yield speciality produce and seafood you won’t find elsewhere – all highlighted in inventive Venetian cuisine, with tantalising traces of ancient spice routes. The city knows how to put on a royal spread, as France’s King Henry III once found out when faced with 1200 dishes and 200 bonbons. Today such feasts are available in miniature at happy hour, when bars mount lavish spreads of cicheti (Venetian tapas). Save room and time for a proper sit-down Venetian meal, with lagoon seafood to match views at canalside bistros and toasts with Veneto’s signature bubbly, prosecco.</p>

<h3>An Artful Lifestyle</h3>
<p>Pity the day trippers dropped off at San Marco with a mere three hours to take in Venice. That’s about enough time for one long gasp at the show-stopper that is Piazza San Marco, but not nearly enough time to see what else Venice is hiding. Stay longer in this fairy-tale city and you’ll discover the pleasures of la bea vita (the beautiful life) that only locals know: the wake-up call of gondoliers calling ‘Ooooeeeee!’, a morning spritz in a sunny campi (square), lunch in a crowded bacaro (bar) with friends and fuschia-pink sunsets that have sent centuries of artists mad.</p>

<h3>Defying Convention</h3>
<p>Eyeglasses, platform shoes and uncorseted dresses are outlandish Venetian fashions that critics sniffed would never be worn by respectable Europeans. Venetians are used to setting trends, whether it be with controversial artwork in the Punta della Dogana, racy operas at La Fenice or radical new art at the Biennale. On a smaller scale, this unconventional creative streak finds vibrant expression in the showrooms of local artisans where you can find custom-made red-carpet shoes, purses fashioned from silk-screened velvet and glass jewels brighter than semi-precious stones. In a world of cookie-cutter culture, Venice’s originality still stands out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>High on History</h3>
<p>Bismarck and Marx, Einstein and Hitler, JFK and Bowie, they’ve all shaped – and been shaped by – Berlin, whose richly textured history confronts you at every turn. This is a city that staged a revolution, was headquartered by Nazis, bombed to bits, divided in two and finally reunited – and that was just in the 20th century! Walk along remnants of the Berlin Wall, marvel at the splendour of a Prussian palace, visit Checkpoint Charlie or stand in the very room where the Holocaust was planned. Berlin is like an endlessly fascinating 3D textbook where the past is very much present wherever you go.</p>

<h3>Party Paradise</h3>
<p>Forget about New York – Berlin is the city that truly never sleeps. Sometimes it seems as though Berliners are the lotus-eaters of Germany, people who love nothing more than a good time. The city&#8217;s vast party spectrum caters for every taste, budget and age group. From tiny basement clubs to industrial techno temples, chestnut-canopied beer gardens to fancy cocktail caverns, saucy cabarets to ear-pleasing symphonies – Berlin delivers hot-stepping odysseys, and not just after dark and on weekends but pretty much 24/7. Pack your stamina!</p>

<h3>Cultural Trendsetter</h3>
<p>When it comes to creativity, the sky’s the limit in Berlin, which is one of Europe&#8217;s big start-up capitals. In the last 20 years, the city has become a giant lab of cultural experimentation thanks to a spirit that nurtures and encourages new ideas as well as to once abundant space and cheap rent. Although the last two of these are definitely a thing of the past. Top international performers still grace Berlin&#8217;s theatre, concert and opera stages; international art-world stars like Olafur Eliasson and Jonathan Meese make their home here; and Clooney and Hanks shoot blockbusters in the German capital. Highbrow, lowbrow and everything in between – there’s plenty of room for the full gamut of cultural expression.</p>

<h3>Laid-back Lifestyle</h3>
<p>Berlin is a big multicultural metropolis but deep down it maintains the unpretentious charm of an international village. Locals and expats follow the credo &#8216;live and let live&#8217; and put greater emphasis on personal freedom and a creative lifestyle than on material wealth and status symbols. Cafes are jammed at all hours, drinking is a religious rite and clubs keep going through the weekend into Monday. Size-wise, Berlin is pretty big but its key areas are wonderfully compact and easily navigated on foot, by bike or with public transport.</p>
