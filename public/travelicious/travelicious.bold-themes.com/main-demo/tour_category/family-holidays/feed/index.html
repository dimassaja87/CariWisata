					<description><![CDATA[Along the Atlantic, the Beira Litoral lures surfers and sunseekers with scores of sandy beaches. Here, the sophisticated university city of Coimbra and the brash casino-party town of Figueira da Foz arm-wrestle for visitors’ attention. Move inland to the Beira Alta highlands and the mood shifts entirely. Stoic stone villages cling to the slopes of Portugal’s highest mountains – the Serra da Estrela – and cast their gaze down at the fertile wine country of the Dão valley.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Ghosts of the Past</h3>
<p>Celts, Romans, Visigoths, Moors and Christians all left their mark on the Iberian nation. Here, you can gaze upon 20,000-year-old stone carvings in the Vila Nova de Foz Côa, watch the sunset over mysterious megaliths outside Évora or lose yourself in the elaborate corridors of Unesco World Heritage Sites in Tomar, Belém, Alcobaça or Batalha. You can pack an itinerary visiting palaces set above mist-covered woodlands, craggy clifftop castles and stunningly preserved medieval town centres.</p>

<h3>The Portuguese Table</h3>
<p>Freshly baked bread, olives, cheese, red wine or crisp vinho verde (young wine), chargrilled fish, cataplana (seafood stew), smoked meats – the Portuguese have perfected the art of cooking simple, delicious meals. Sitting down to table means experiencing the richness of Portugal’s bountiful coastline and fertile countryside. Of course, you don’t have to sit; you can take your piping-hot pastel de nata (custard tart) standing up at an 1837 patisserie in Belém, or wander through scenic vineyards sipping the velvety ports of the Douro Valley. You can shop the produce-filled markets, or book a table in one of the country’s top dining rooms.</p>

<h3>Cinematic Scenery</h3>
<p>Outside the cities, Portugal’s beauty unfolds in all its startling variety. You can go hiking amid the granite peaks of Parque Nacional da Peneda-Gerês or take in the pristine scenery and historic villages of the little-explored Beiras. Over 800km of coast offers more places to soak up the splendour. Gaze out over dramatic end-of-the-world cliffs, surf stellar breaks off dune-covered beaches or laze peacefully on sandy islands fronting calm blue seas. You’ll find dolphin watching in the lush Sado Estuary, boating and kayaking along the meandering Rio Guadiana, and memorable walks and bike rides all across the country.</p>

<h3>Rhythms of Portugal</h3>
<p>Festivals pack Portugal’s calendar. Drink, dance and feast your way through all-night revelries like Lisbon’s Festa de Santo António or Porto’s Festa de São João. There are kick-up-your-heels country fairs in the hinterlands, and rock- and world-music fests all along the coast. Any time of year is right to hear the mournful music of fado in the Alfama, join the dance party in Bairro Alto or hit the bars in Porto, Coimbra and Lagos.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Central Dalmatia is the most action-packed and diverse part of Croatia, with pretty islands, quiet ports, rugged mountains, numerous castles and an emerging culinary scene, as well as three Unesco World Heritage sites: Diocletian’s Palace in Split, the medieval walled town of Trogir and the ancient strip fields of the Stari Grad plain on the island of Hvar. Throughout it all, the rugged 1500m-high Dinaric Range provides a dramatic background.]]></description>

<h3>Dramatic Backgrounds</h3>
<p>Throughout it all, the rugged 1500m-high Dinaric Range provides a dramatic background. Hot spots include the buzzing Mediterranean-flavoured city of Split and gorgeous little Hvar Town, where the cashed meet the trashed on the Adriatic&#8217;s most glamorous party island. But if it&#8217;s relaxation you&#8217;re after, there are seductive sandy beaches and pebbly coves scattered about islands near and far. Best of all, Dalmatia is usually warmer than Istria or the Kvarner Gulf. You can plunge into the crystalline Adriatic from the middle of May right up until the end of September.</p>

<h3>Plain Sailing</h3>
<p>Yachties can sail between unpopulated islands without a shred of development, lost in dreams of the Mediterranean of old, while hikers can wander lonely trails where bears and wolves still dwell, and explore three of Croatia&#8217;s most impressive national parks, which shelter in the hinterland.<br />
By contrast, Zadar is a cultured city rich in museums, Roman ruins, restaurants and hip bars. Summertime clubbers gravitate to Zrće Beach and Tisno, which together form the nucleus of Croatia’s premier clubbing scene.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-3007 size-medium" src="https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-dalmatia-01-640x427.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="801" srcset="https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-dalmatia-01-640x427.jpg 640w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-dalmatia-01-1280x854.jpg 1280w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-dalmatia-01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-dalmatia-01-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-dalmatia-01-800x534.jpg 800w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-dalmatia-01-320x213.jpg 320w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-dalmatia-01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-dalmatia-01.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3>Magnificent Dubrovnik</h3>
<p>Yet one location understandably eclipses any discussion of Southern Dalmatia: the remarkable old town of Dubrovnik. Ringed by mighty defensive walls that dip their feet in the cerulean sea, the city encapsulates the very essence of a medieval Mediterranean fantasy. Dubrovnik is simply unique; its beauty is bewitching, its setting sublime. Thousands of visitors walk along its marble streets every day, gazing, gasping and happily snapping away.</p>
<p>When Dubrovnik&#8217;s tourist scrum threatens to overwhelm, a reinvigorating balm is but a quick boat or bus ride away. Refresh yourself on the shady paths of Trsteno Arboretum or, if that doesn&#8217;t do the trick, the divine wine and oysters of the sparsely populated Pelješac Peninsula surely will.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Castle District encompasses Castle Hill (Várhegy) – nerve centre of Budapest’s history and packed with many of the capital’s most important museums and other attractions – as well as ground-level Víziváros (Watertown). What the latter lacks in sights it makes up for in excellent restaurants, many of them around Széll Kálmán tér, a major transport hub and the centre of urban Buda.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The Human Touch</h3>
<p>Budapest’s beauty is not all God given; humankind has played a role in shaping this pretty face too. Architecturally, the city is a treasure trove, with enough baroque, neoclassical, Eclectic and art nouveau buildings to satisfy everyone. Overall, though, Budapest has a fin de siècle feel to it, for it was then, during the capital’s ‘golden age&#8217; in the late 19th century, that most of what you see today was built.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-3021 size-medium" src="https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-budapest-04-640x427.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="801" srcset="https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-budapest-04-640x427.jpg 640w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-budapest-04-1280x854.jpg 1280w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-budapest-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-budapest-04-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-budapest-04-800x534.jpg 800w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-budapest-04-320x213.jpg 320w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-budapest-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-budapest-04.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3>The Past at Hand</h3>
<p>They say the past is another country, but it’s always been just around the corner in Budapest. Witness the bullet holes and shrapnel pockmarks on buildings from WWII and the 1956 Uprising. There are sad reminders like the poignant Shoes on the Danube memorial, but ones, too, of hope and reconciliation – like the &#8216;sword&#8217; of the former secret-police building on Andrássy út now beaten into the &#8216;ploughshare&#8217; that is the House of Terror, with both sides of the story told.</p>

<h3>Eat, Drink &amp; Be Magyar</h3>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot more to Hungarian food than goulash, and it remains one of the most sophisticated styles of cooking in Europe. Magyars may exaggerate when they say that there are three essential world cuisines: French, Chinese and their own. But Budapest’s reputation as a food capital dates largely from the late 19th and the first half of the 20th century and, despite a fallow period under communism, the city is once again commanding attention. So, too, are Hungary&#8217;s excellent wines – from Eger&#8217;s complex reds and Somló’s flinty whites to honey-sweet Tokaj.</p>

<h3>In the Soak</h3>
<p>The city is blessed with an abundance of hot springs. As a result, ‘taking the waters’ has been a Budapest experience since the time of the Romans. The choice of bathhouses is generous – you can choose among Turkish-era, art nouveau and modern establishments. Some people come seeking a cure for whatever ails them, but the majority are there for fun and relaxation – though we still maintain it’s the world’s best cure for what Hungarians call a macskajaj (cat’s wail) – hangover.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[While it might lack the world-class cultural institutions of Berlin, Belgrade, at the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers, offers its own distinctive appeal, with storybook historical districts and venerable fortresses and parks. Better still, this center of Slavic cool just got much easier to reach: Direct flights from North America, via New York City, started in June on Air Serbia. Throw in Belgrade’s cafe scene, low prices, talented young designers, emerging former industrial districts, sausage-filled cuisine and unbridled night life — from D.J. bars to party boats to all-hours nightclubs — and the comparison seems even more compelling.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the oldest cities in Europe and the only one built on the confluence of two rivers, Belgrade is the city that never sleeps and the symbol of great nightlife. The capital of Serbia, Belgrade, is known as “the city that never sleeps”. Floating clubs on its rivers have become synonyms for great parties and neverending fun, and Skadarlija, the bohemian street, for a place where music and singing can be heard until dawn.</p>
<p>And yet, Belgrade is one of the oldest cities in Europe. This “white city” is the only capital built at the confluence of two big rivers – the Danube and the Sava.</p>

<h3>Modern in it&#8217;s heart</h3>
<p>Belgrade is a modern european city with population of about 1.7 million people. It is an administrative, political and cultural center of the country. The sessions of Serbian parliament and government are being held in Belgrade, and the office of the President is also in it. The buildings that host these institutions are themselves monuments of great cultural importance and therefore a part of every visitor’s itinerary.</p>
<p>The place where Belgrade is today has been inhabited from ancient times. One of the cities quarters, Vinča, is the home of prehistoric culture of the same name.</p>
<p>Nowadays in it this part of the city you can find an archaeological site perfect for all those interested in very distant history. After this period, many tribes and nations have lived in the area – the Celts have called their settlement Singidun but the Slavs named it “The White City”.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2636" src="http://travelicious.omnicom-dev.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2018/09/destination-belgrade-03-1280x854.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="801" srcset="https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-belgrade-03-1280x854.jpg 1280w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-belgrade-03-640x427.jpg 640w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-belgrade-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-belgrade-03-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-belgrade-03-800x534.jpg 800w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-belgrade-03-320x213.jpg 320w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-belgrade-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/destination-belgrade-03.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3>Just one of many names</h3>
<p>Since then, it has been known by many names – Alba Bulgariae, Alabanandor, Nandoralba, Nandorfejervar, Griechisch Weissenburg, Alba Graeca, Castelbiancho… but the name of the fortress that, when looked at from the Pannonian side and the rivers appears white, remained until today: WHITEcity (BEOgrad – Belgrade).</p>
<p>All the people that have lived here and the armies that passed through Belgrade have left their marks on the city, and the magnificent Victor monument, the remains of the Belgrade fortress, the Stambol gate, the Old Palace and many other sites of Belgrade are inviting you to discover them.</p>
<p>The city never stops growing, and when it has crossed the river Sava, it became “new”. New Belgrade (Novi Beograd) is the center of Serbia’s business.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The earliest structures in the colony were built to the bare minimum of standards. Upon his appointment, Governor Lachlan Macquarie set ambitious targets for the architectural design of new construction projects.

<p>The Sydney area has been inhabited by indigenous Australians for at least 30,000 years. Lieutenant James Cook first landed at Kurnell in 1770, when navigating his way up the east coast of Australia on his ship, HMS Endeavour. It was not until 1788 when the First Fleet, which contained convicts and was led by Captain Arthur Phillip, arrived in Botany Bay to found Sydney as a penal colony, the first European settlement in Australia. Phillip named the city &#8220;Sydney&#8221; in recognition of Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney, Home Secretary in 1788. The Sydney region is one of the richest in Australia in terms of Aboriginal archaeological sites, with significant rock art and engravings located in the protected Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park.</p>
<p>Despite being one of the most expensive cities in the world, the 2018 Mercer Quality of Living Survey ranks Sydney tenth in the world in terms of quality of living, making it one of the most livable cities. It is classified as an Alpha World City by Globalization and World Cities Research Network, indicating its influence in the region and throughout the world.Ranked eleventh in the world for economic opportunity, Sydney has an advanced market economy with strengths in finance, manufacturing and tourism.There is a significant concentration of foreign banks and multinational corporations in Sydney and the city is promoted as one of Asia Pacific&#8217;s leading financial hubs. Established in 1850, the University of Sydney is Australia&#8217;s first university and is regarded as one of the world&#8217;s leading universities. Sydney is also home to the oldest library in Australia, State Library of New South Wales, opened in 1826.</p>

<p>Sydney hosted international multi-sport events such as the 1938 British Empire Games and 2000 Summer Olympics. The city is amongst the top fifteen most-visited cities in the world, with millions of tourists coming each year to see the city&#8217;s landmarks. Boasting over 1,000,000 ha (2,500,000 acres) of nature reserves and parks, its notable natural features include Sydney Harbour, the Royal National Park, and the Royal Botanic Garden. Man-made attractions such as Sydney Tower, the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and the Sydney Opera House (which became a World Heritage Site in 2007), are also well known to international visitors. The main passenger airport serving the metropolitan area is Kingsford-Smith Airport, one of the world&#8217;s oldest continually operating airports. Opened in 1906, Central station is the main hub of the city&#8217;s rail network.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A trip to Rome is as much about lapping up the dolce vita lifestyle as gorging on art and culture.

<h3>Historical Legacies</h3>
<p>The result of 3000 years of ad hoc urban development, Rome&#8217;s cityscape is an exhilarating spectacle. Ancient icons such as the Colosseum, Roman Forum and Pantheon recall the city’s golden age as caput mundi (capital of the world), while its many monumental basilicas testify to its historical role as seat of the Catholic Church. Lording it over the skyline, St Peter’s Basilica is the Vatican’s epic showpiece church, a towering masterpiece of Renaissance architecture. Elsewhere, ornate piazzas and showy fountains add a baroque flourish to the city&#8217;s captivating streets.</p>

<h3>Artistic Riches</h3>
<p>Few cities can rival Rome&#8217;s astonishing artistic heritage. Throughout history, the city has starred in the great upheavals of Western art, drawing the top artists of the day and inspiring them to push the boundaries of creative achievement. The result is a city awash with priceless treasures. Ancient statues adorn world-class museums; Byzantine mosaics and Renaissance frescoes dazzle in the city&#8217;s art-rich churches; baroque facades flank medieval piazzas. Walk around the centre and without even trying you’ll come across masterpieces by the giants of Western art – sculptures by Michelangelo, canvases by Caravaggio, Raphael frescoes and fountains by Bernini.</p>

<h3>Living the Life</h3>
<p>A trip to Rome is as much about lapping up the dolce vita lifestyle as gorging on art and culture. Idling around picturesque streets, whiling away hours at streetside cafes, people-watching on pretty piazzas – these are all an integral part of the Roman experience. The tempo rises as the heat of the day gives way to the evening cool and the fashionably dressed aperitivo (pre-dinner drinks) crowd descends on the city&#8217;s bars and cafes. Restaurants and trattorias hum with activity and cheerful hordes mill around popular haunts before heading off to cocktail bars and late-night clubs.</p>

<h3>Roman Feasting</h3>
<p>Eating out is one of Rome&#8217;s great pleasures and the combination of romantic alfresco settings and superlative food is a guarantee of good times. For contemporary fine dining and five-star wine there are any number of refined restaurants, but for a truly Roman meal head to a boisterous pizzeria or convivial neighbourhood trattoria. These are where the locals go to dine with friends and indulge their passion for thin, crispy pizzas, humble pastas, and cool white wines from the nearby Castelli Romani hills. Then to finish off, what about a gelato followed by a shot of world-beating coffee?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Tokyo feels limitless in size and scope and often seems more like a collection of cities than one cohesive whole. At the centre is the Imperial Palace. To the east of the palace is the old city, the historic downtown that came to life during the feudal era (when a castle stood where the palace is today). Here, in neighbourhoods like Ueno and Asakusa, the attractions have a more traditional slant: there are museums, shrines and temples, historic restaurants and artisan workshops.]]></description>

<p>Tokyo&#8217;s neon-lit streetscapes still look like a sci-fi film set – and that&#8217;s a vision of the city from the 1980s. Tokyo has been building ever since, pushing the boundaries of what&#8217;s possible on densely populated, earthquake-prone land, adding ever taller, sleeker structures. Come see the utopian mega-malls, the edgy designer boutiques from Japan&#8217;s award-winning architects, and the world&#8217;s tallest tower – Tokyo Sky Tree – a twisting spire that draws on ancient building techniques. Stand atop one of Tokyo&#8217;s skyscrapers and look out over the city at night to see it blinking like the control panel of a starship, stretching all the way to the horizon.</p>

<p>Tokyo may be forever reaching into the future but you can still see traces of the shogun&#8217;s capital on the kabuki stage, at a sumo tournament or under the cherry blossoms. It&#8217;s a modern city built on old patterns, and in the shadows of skyscrapers you can find anachronistic wooden shanty bars and quiet alleys, raucous traditional festivals and lantern-lit yakitori (grilled chicken) stands. In older neighbourhoods you can shop for handicrafts made just as they have been for centuries, or wander down cobblestone lanes where geisha once trod.</p>

<p>Yes, Tokyo has more Michelin stars than any other city. Yes, Japanese cuisine has been added to the Unesco Intangible Cultural Heritage list. But that&#8217;s not what makes dining in Tokyo such an amazing experience. What really counts is the city&#8217;s long-standing artisan culture. You can splash out on the best sushi of your life, made by one of the city&#8217;s legendary chefs using the freshest, seasonal market ingredients. You can also spend ¥800 on a bowl of noodles made with the same care and exacting attention to detail, from a recipe honed through decades of experience.</p>

<p>From giant robots to saucer-eyed schoolgirls to a certain, ubiquitous kitty, Japanese pop culture is a phenomenon that has reached far around the world. Tokyo is the country&#8217;s pop-culture laboratory, where new trends grow legs. Come see the latest looks bubbling out of the backstreets of Harajuku, the hottest pop stars projected on the giant video screens in Shibuya, or the newest anime and manga flying off the shelves in Akihabara. Gawk at the giant statues of Godzilla; shop for your favourite character goods; or pick up some style inspiration just walking down the street.</p>
