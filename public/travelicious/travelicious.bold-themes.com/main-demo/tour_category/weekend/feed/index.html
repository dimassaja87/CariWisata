					<description><![CDATA[The southern city of Kaohsiung is Taiwan's largest port, its second-largest city and centre of the country's heavy and petrochemical industries. Despite this, today's Kaohsiung is a modern urban landscape of airy cafes, wide streets, waterside parks, public transport, bicycle lanes and cultural venues that have embraced and re-imagined the city's manufacturing past.]]></description>

<h3>The Culture</h3>
<p>Located in southwestern Taiwan, Kaohsiung is a city of a longish shape. It is cast in sunshine throughout a year and its weather is amiable. Mountains, oceans, rivers and ports make the city’s geology and culture highly diverse. Kaohsiung used to enjoy a thriving economy for its steel and petrochemical industries, but now it is gearing towards cultural tourism, touting its history, nature and hospitality. An oceanic tourist capital it is!</p>

<h3>River Ports &amp; Oceanic Tourism</h3>
<p>In Taiwan, people call Kaohsiung “the port city” because it has the most beautiful port views. The magnificent Kaohsiung Port, modern-style Singuang and Glory Ferry Wharfs, and romantic Love River all enhance Kaohsiung’s urban charm. Taking a ferry is actually a popular tourist activity in Kaohsiung.</p>
<p>Visitors may take a ferry at Shaochuantou Wharf so and then hop off in Qijin to enjoy a walk, or take the Love Boat or a fancy gondola by the Love River. Cultural yachts are an option, too – the yacht trip is longer, allowing visitors to immerse in the splendid views of Kaohsiung’s ports and the Asian New Bay Area.</p>

<h3>Tapping into History</h3>
<p>Kaohsiung was previously named “Takau,” referring to the bamboo forests dwelled by indigenous Makatau. During the Qing Rule, it was renamed as “Dagou” and by the Japanese Rule a Dagou office was to be established on Qijin Street. The Dagou Branch Office of Tainan Prefecture was therefore relocated to Shaochuantou. In 1920 (9th year of Taisho), Kaohsiung Prefecture was established. The Japanese adopted the name “Kaohsiung” from “Takau.”</p>

<h3>Natural Resources &amp; Great Views</h3>
<p>Kaohsiung has more than modernized urban scenery and the vitality which comes in from the ocean; it also boasts an expansive hinterland, with rich natural and cultural resources, fields and gardens, forests, mountains, hot springs- it has everything.</p>
<p>The strange “Moon World” formations near Tianliao, Yenchao, and Neimen, known as “badlands” in the field of geography, form mainly as a result of rainwater and river water scouring mudstone areas which have soft soil. It is difficult for plants to grow in such an environment, which exposes the mudstone, creating a unique landscape densely covered with ridges and trenches. In fact, Moon World&#8217;s geographic richness and rarity has already met UNESCO Geoparks&#8217;standards for recognition as a Geological Heritage Site. What&#8217;s more, Purple Crow Butterfly Valley in Maolin Scenic Area is also a world-class natural resource, one of just two valleys in the world in which butterflies winter.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Oslo is blessed with some incredibly beautiful parks which manage, in typical Norwegian style, to straddle the line between a bucolic naturalness and well-kept grace. As soon as the sun is out this is where you'll find locals lolling, picnicking and often getting their gear off and catching some rays.]]></description>

<h3>Cultural Life</h3>
<p>Come to Oslo to pay homage to Edvard Munch and Henrik Ibsen, the city’s two most famous sons, by all means. But don’t leave without discovering something of its contemporary cultural life too. Explore one of its many museums, get to know its booming contemporary-art scene at one of its commercial galleries or just marvel at the work of its architects. You can also walk the neighbourhoods that may already be familiar via the works of Karl Ove Knausgård, whose autobiographical novel series Min Kamp are set here, along with the mean streets of Norwegian-noir crime writers Jo Nesbø and Anne Holt.</p>

<h3>Natural Pleasures</h3>
<p>Oslo&#8217;s skyline might be crowded by cranes but this rapidly growing urban metropolis is also one of the world’s most overwhelmingly green cities. It has earned the honour of being named European Green Capital for 2019, via one of the lowest carbon footprints in the world, excellent and well-patronised public transport, city planning that puts pedestrians first, and a real commitment to sustainable food production and green space. The city is blessed with a large number of bucolic parks, and the Oslofjord’s waterways and islands are just minutes away from the centre, as are the ski slopes and forests of Nordmarka.</p>

<h3>Culinary Capital</h3>
<p>Once known only for hot dogs and high prices, Oslo’s culinary scene is currently enjoying a Neo Nordic moment in the sun, and has become a culinary destination in its own right. This delicious change takes in everything from the most northern three-Michelin-starred restaurant in the world (Maaemo) to its deservedly hyped neighbourhood coffee scene to fabulous fusion (Icelandic-Korean is the hottest ticket in town) to the celebration of traditional favourites such as peel-and-eat shrimp, and, yes, even polse (hot dogs). The city also has a penchant for sushi and pizza, both of which can now compete on the world stage.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2951 size-medium" src="https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-oslo-04-640x427.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="801" srcset="https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-oslo-04-640x427.jpg 640w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-oslo-04-1280x854.jpg 1280w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-oslo-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-oslo-04-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-oslo-04-800x534.jpg 800w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-oslo-04-320x213.jpg 320w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-oslo-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://travelicious.bold-themes.com/main-demo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/tour-oslo-04.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3>Cracking Nightlife</h3>
<p>Has Oslo become Scandinavia&#8217;s late-night party hot spot? Wander Møllegata on a, well, Wednesday and you might be convinced it is. Whether it&#8217;s working your way through a list of the latest natural wine from Burgenland or Sicily, getting your hands in the air with local DJ acts such as Lindstøm and Prins Thomas or an international indie band, drinking a local beer over a game of shuffleboard or sipping cocktails made from foraged spruce or Arctic seaweed, you&#8217;ll notice that, with a grungier, wilder, realer edge than Copenhagen or Stockholm, this is certainly a city that knows how to have fun.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Barcelona is an enchanting seaside city with boundless culture, fabled architecture and a world-class drinking and dining scene. Barcelona's architectural treasures span 2000-plus years. Towering temple columns, ancient city walls and subterranean stone corridors provide a window into Roman-era Barcino. Fast forward a thousand years or so to the Middle Ages by taking a stroll through the shadowy lanes of the Gothic quarter, past tranquil plazas and soaring 14th-century cathedrals.]]></description>

<p>Barcelona&#8217;s architectural treasures span 2000-plus years. Towering temple columns, ancient city walls and subterranean stone corridors provide a window into Roman-era Barcino. Fast forward a thousand years or so to the Middle Ages by taking a stroll through the shadowy lanes of the Gothic quarter, past tranquil plazas and soaring 14th-century cathedrals. In other parts of town bloom the sculptural masterpieces of Modernisme, a mix of ingenious and whimsical creations by Gaudí and his Catalan architectural contemporaries. Barcelona has also long inspired artists, including Pablo Picasso and Joan Miró, both of whom have major Barcelona museums devoted to their works.</p>

<h3>A Moveable Feast</h3>
<p>The masters of molecular gastronomy – Albert Adrià, Carles Abellan et al – are part of the long and celebrated tradition of Catalan cooking. Simple, flavourful ingredients – seafood, jamón (cured ham), market-fresh produce – are transformed into remarkable delicacies and then served in captivating settings. Feast on hearty, rich paella at an outdoor table overlooking the sea or step back to the 1920s at an elegant art nouveau dining room. Barcelona&#8217;s wide-ranging palate adds further complexity: Basque-style tapas bars, Galician seafood taverns, avant-garde Japanese restaurants and sinful chocolate shops are all essential parts of the culinary landscape.</p>
<h3>Under the Iberian Sun</h3>
<p>The deep blue Mediterranean beckons. Sun-drenched beaches make a fine backdrop to a jog, bike ride or long leisurely stroll along the seaside – followed by a refreshing dip. You can also enjoy the view from out on the water while kayaking, stand-up paddleboarding or taking it easy on a sunset cruise. Looming behind the city, the rolling forest-covered Collserola hills provide a scenic setting for hiking, mountain biking or just admiring the view. Closer to the city centre, hilltop Montjuïc offers endless exploring amid botanic and sculpture gardens, an old castle and first-rate museums with panoramic views at every turn.</p>

<h3>Twenty-four-hour Party People</h3>
<p>The night holds limitless possibilities in Barcelona. Start with sunset drinks on a panoramic terrace or dig your heels in the sand at a rustic beachside chiringuito (bar). As darkness falls, live music transforms the city: the rapid-fire rhythms of flamenco, brassy jazz spilling out of basements, and hands-in-the-air indie-rock at vintage concert halls. Towards midnight the bars fill. Take your pick from old-school taverns adorned with 19th-century murals, plush lounges in lamp-lit medieval chambers or boisterous cava bars. If you&#8217;re still standing at 3am, hit the clubs and explore Barcelona&#8217;s unabashed wild side.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Immersed in history, London's rich seams of eye-opening antiquity are everywhere. The city's buildings are striking milestones in a unique and beguiling biography, and a great many of them – the Tower of London, Westminster Abbey, Big Ben – are instantly recognisable landmarks. There’s more than enough innovation (the Shard, the Tate Modern extension, the planned Garden Bridge) to put a crackle in the air, but it never drowns out London’s seasoned, centuries-old narrative.]]></description>

<h3>Art &amp; Culture</h3>
<p>A tireless innovator of art and culture, London is a city of ideas and the imagination. Londoners have always been fiercely independent thinkers (and critics), but until not so long ago people were suspicious of anything they considered avant-garde. That’s in the past now, and the city’s creative milieu is streaked with left-field attitude, whether it&#8217;s theatrical innovation, contemporary art, pioneering music, writing, poetry, architecture or design. Food is another creative arena that has become a tireless obsession in certain circles.</p>

<h3>Diversity</h3>
<p>This city is deeply multicultural, with one in three Londoners foreign-born, representing 270 nationalities and 300 tongues. Britain may have voted for Brexit (although the majority of Londoners didn&#8217;t), but for now London remains one of the world&#8217;s most cosmopolitan cities, and diversity infuses daily life, food, music and fashion. It even penetrates intrinsically British institutions; the British Museum and Victoria &amp; Albert Museum have collections as varied as they are magnificent, while the flavours at centuries-old Borough Market run the full global gourmet spectrum.</p>

<h3>A Tale of Two Cities</h3>
<p>London is as much about wide-open vistas and leafy landscape escapes as it is high-density, sight-packed urban exploration. Central London is where the major museums, galleries and most iconic sights congregate, but visit Hampstead Heath or the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park to flee the crowds and frolic in wide open green expanses. You can also venture further out to Kew Gardens, Richmond or Hampton Court Palace for beautiful panoramas of riverside London followed by a pint in a quiet waterside pub.</p>
