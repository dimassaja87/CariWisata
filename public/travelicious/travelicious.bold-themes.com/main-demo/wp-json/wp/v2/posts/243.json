First, it is necessary to understand the geography of the country. It consists of two distinct parts, Peninsula Malaysia and Malaysian Borneo separated by the South China Sea. Between the two sections of the country, Malaysia consists of modern cities, beach resorts, rainforests, jungle, highland retreats, national parks and much more. The country has an abundance of outstanding natural beauty be it gorgeous beaches, exotic mountainous terrain or fascinating tropical rainforests. Malaysia\u2019s national parks are superb for trekking and wildlife-watching, and sometimes for cave exploration and river rafting on Malaysia vacations.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Malaysia is a country unlike any other: Full of promise and fragility. Its history, cultural and religious diversity make it a rich, compelling and surprising land.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Another Malaysian quality is its multiethnic influences with its predominant native Malay, Chinese and Indian cultures all live side by side together in peace and harmony. This mixture has influenced both the cultural diversity and the varied cuisine of Malaysia. It is no wonder that Malays love celebrating and socializing. As a people, Malaysians are very relaxed, warm and friendly.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2229 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/travelicious.omnicom-dev.com\/main-demo\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/4\/2015\/07\/post_04-1280x854.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" srcset=\"https:\/\/travelicious.bold-themes.com\/main-demo\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2015\/07\/post_04-1280x854.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/travelicious.bold-themes.com\/main-demo\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2015\/07\/post_04-640x427.jpg 640w, https:\/\/travelicious.bold-themes.com\/main-demo\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2015\/07\/post_04-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/travelicious.bold-themes.com\/main-demo\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2015\/07\/post_04-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/travelicious.bold-themes.com\/main-demo\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2015\/07\/post_04-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/travelicious.bold-themes.com\/main-demo\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2015\/07\/post_04-800x533.jpg 800w, https:\/\/travelicious.bold-themes.com\/main-demo\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2015\/07\/post_04-320x213.jpg 320w, https:\/\/travelicious.bold-themes.com\/main-demo\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2015\/07\/post_04-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/p>\n<h5><strong>What are the top cities to visit in Malaysia?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Where to go and what to see on Malaysia tours? Starting with Peninsula Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur is the capital, a city which combines the old and the new with its bustling markets, steel-clad skyscrapers, large shopping malls and trendy nightspots. It\u2019s hard to not notice the twin Petronas Towers, opened in 1998 and world\u2019s tallest structure until 2004 which offer amazing views of the city. Merdeka Square, where Malaysian independence was declared in 1957, is ringed by heritage buildings. The colourful, ornate Sri Mahamariamman Temple is a lively Hindu temple and the oldest in Malaysia. To see the Chinese influence, head to Petaling Street with its restaurants and street food stalls.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2362 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/travelicious.omnicom-dev.com\/main-demo\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/4\/2018\/07\/post_malaysia_01-1280x854.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" srcset=\"https:\/\/travelicious.bold-themes.com\/main-demo\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2018\/07\/post_malaysia_01-1280x854.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/travelicious.bold-themes.com\/main-demo\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2018\/07\/post_malaysia_01-640x427.jpg 640w, https:\/\/travelicious.bold-themes.com\/main-demo\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2018\/07\/post_malaysia_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/travelicious.bold-themes.com\/main-demo\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2018\/07\/post_malaysia_01-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/travelicious.bold-themes.com\/main-demo\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2018\/07\/post_malaysia_01-800x534.jpg 800w, https:\/\/travelicious.bold-themes.com\/main-demo\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2018\/07\/post_malaysia_01-320x213.jpg 320w, https:\/\/travelicious.bold-themes.com\/main-demo\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2018\/07\/post_malaysia_01-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/travelicious.bold-themes.com\/main-demo\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2018\/07\/post_malaysia_01.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/p>\n<h5><strong>What are the top places to see in Malaysia?<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Just outside the city is the sumptuous National Palace contained in its own grounds and home to the elected Monarch. Also close to Kuala Lumpur are the Batu Caves with their Hindu rock carvings and unique rock formations. The best known museum is the National Museum with its exhibits from Malaysian history and crafts.<\/p>\n<p>On Malaysia vacations, the second most important destination is Penang, literally an island off the coast of Western Peninsula Malaysia. Georgetown, its capital, brings back memories of the old colonial era depicted in its architecture and the historic Fort Cornwallis built in the late 18th Century. However, perhaps Penang\u2019s biggest attraction is its beach resorts such as those found in Batu Ferringhi. A visit to Penang Hill introduces you to some of the grandest colonial mansions while enjoying the cool, refreshing air and panoramic views of the island. Another attraction is the tropical butterfly farm in Teluk Bahang with its live museum of winged butterflies. Something different is the Snake Temple, home to several pit vipers and green tree snakes and featured in \u201cIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\u201d.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2363 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/travelicious.omnicom-dev.com\/main-demo\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/4\/2018\/07\/post_malaysia_02-1280x854.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" srcset=\"https:\/\/travelicious.bold-themes.com\/main-demo\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2018\/07\/post_malaysia_02-1280x854.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/travelicious.bold-themes.com\/main-demo\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2018\/07\/post_malaysia_02-640x427.jpg 640w, https:\/\/travelicious.bold-themes.com\/main-demo\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2018\/07\/post_malaysia_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/travelicious.bold-themes.com\/main-demo\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2018\/07\/post_malaysia_02-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/travelicious.bold-themes.com\/main-demo\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2018\/07\/post_malaysia_02-800x534.jpg 800w, https:\/\/travelicious.bold-themes.com\/main-demo\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2018\/07\/post_malaysia_02-320x213.jpg 320w, https:\/\/travelicious.bold-themes.com\/main-demo\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2018\/07\/post_malaysia_02-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/travelicious.bold-themes.com\/main-demo\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2018\/07\/post_malaysia_02.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Malacca, in the south, has a colonial past reflected in its preserved town centre. Influences include Portuguese, Dutch and British rules that all left behind their historical and cultural backgrounds. The older part of the city has, in addition to the old palace and the large buildings left by the Europeans, many private houses and shops from nearly a century or more ago. Some of the buildings well worth visiting are the Cheng Hoon Teng Temple, the oldest Chinese temple in Malaysia, the Fort of Santiago from the Portuguese era and St. Paul\u2019s Church, originally built in 1521 by the Portuguese. It has been used as a burial ground for the Dutch and you can still see the tombstone along the walls of ruins of the church.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Malaysia Travel Information<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>At Goway we believe that a well-informed traveller is a safer traveller.
